Prepare for the future.\n\nThe third game in the Fallout series, Fallout 3 is a singleplayer action role-playing game (RPG) set in a post-apocalyptic Washington DC. Combining the horrific insanity of the Cold War era theory of mutually assured destruction gone terribly wrong, with the kitschy naivety of American 1950s nuclear propaganda, Fallout 3 will satisfy both players familiar with the popular first two games in its series as well as those coming to the franchise for the first time.",

The game's tongue-in-cheek humor, innovative combat and strong storyline keep Stubbs the Zombie's gameplay as bizarre and unpredictable as its namesake.\n\nOn his quest, Stubbs lurches his way through numerous large and visually captivating indoor/outdoor environments in and around the gleaming city of Punchbowl, PA, a city built during the Eisenhower administration to show off the ultra-futuristic technology of the 21st century. Stubbs' brain-eating adventure brings him through bustling shopping districts and verdant farmlands to battle mad scientists, rural militiamen and the world's deadliest barbershop quartet. His enemies have shotguns, tanks, and all manner of futuristic weaponry. All Stubbs has is his own rotting corpse, a distinct lack of pain or conscience, and the ability to turn foes into zombie allies.\n\nWhat begins as one zombie's search for revenge quickly escalates into an all-out war between the living and the dead - but this time it's the zombie fighting for truth, justice and the redemption of true love. Yes, it's a love story too.",

The player progresses by manipulating the two brothers at the same time to complete various puzzles, often requiring the player to manipulate both brothers to perform differing functions (such as one distracting a hostile non-player character while the other makes their way around).\n\nShould either brother fall from a great height or get injured, the game restarts at a recent checkpoint.

Created by Double Fine's lead animator, Tasha Harris, the game follows the adventure of a group of young friends who must rid their neighborhood of monsters using only their wits, their bravery, and their home-made costumes. Players go door-to-door collecting candy, points, cards, battle stamps and quest assignments as they prepare themselves for Combat Mode-where they transform into larger-than-life versions of their costumes. Each costume that comes-to-life provides its own unique set of superpowers that players will need to battle Halloweens worst monsters.",

The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle.\n\nThe pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive.\n\nMake life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.",

Living poor and dying young, the lower class unite in protest as a new kind of family, gangs, who turn to a life in the underworld in their struggle to survive. A struggle, until watchful Assassins come to their side and re-ignite an age-old conflict involving London’s leaders that will echo throughout modern history, from the underground up.\n\nIntroducing Jacob Frye, who with the help of his twin sister Evie, will change the fate of millions in Assassin’s Creed Syndicate.

    "summary": "Become the Master Assassin in an intense spy-thriller story. As Agent 47, you perform contract hits on powerful, high-profile targets in exotic locations around the world. Gameplay focuses on taking out targets in huge and intricate sandbox levels with complete freedom of approach. Where to go, when to strike and who to kill – it is all up to you.\n\nHitman is an expanding and evolving world of assassination. The experience began with a Prologue and Paris location in March, continued with Episode 2: Sapienza in April, Episode 3: Marrakesh in May, the Summer Bonus Episode in July, Episode 4: Bangkok in August and Episode 5: Colorado in September. The season finale in Hokkaido, Japan arrived on October 31st.\n\nHITMAN also features a major live component, which is made up of Elusive Targets, Escalation Contracts, Community-inspired Challenge Packs and Contracts Mode.\n\nAn Elusive Target is the closest thing to the Hitman fantasy that we’ve ever created. These targets will be custom-created characters that are added to existing locations and are only there for a limited time in real-time. You’ll only have one chance to take them down. If they escape, they are gone for good. If you kill them, that’s the way that you killed them. There are no do-overs and no second chances. When an Elusive Target leaves the game world (one way or another) they never return.\n\nEscalation Mode is something else completely new for HITMAN and was created as a way to regularly provide a fresh challenge to players. You’ll need to master the location as well as the gameplay mechanics to complete a hit that will escalate in difficulty by adding new elements. This mode has a strong focus on having fun with the game mechanics and mixing them up. It’s more about being playful than realistic.\n\nContracts Mode returns from Hitman Absolution; Play-to-create, mark your own targets, choose how to kill them and compete against your friends. We will also pick the best of the bunch and put them in the Featured Contracts list so you’ve got something fresh to play whenever you load up the game.",

Platforms and obstacles appear and disappear as the background colour changes, so if you can’t see something, it doesn’t exist. Whether you're playing alone or with friends, Runbow is fast, frantic, and a lot of fun.\n\nPlayers can race against each other in The Runbow Run, or go head to head in a number of different modes including King of the Hill and Arena to name a few. Use the Wii U GamePad to become the malevolent ColourMaster controlling the colours and the obstacles in the level, or tackle our toughest game mode, The Bowhemoth, a 30+ minute platforming challenge that will put the patience and skill of even the toughest players to the test.\n\nIf dozens of game modes, hundreds of unlockable costumes, and a crazy, colourful gaming challenge sounds like fun, then you better get ready to Runbow!",

The gameplay and tone of the stories are as varied as the family members themselves. The only constants are that each is played from a first-person perspective and that each story ends with that family member's death. It's a game about what it feels like to be humbled and astonished by the vast and unknowable world around us.\n\nYou'll follow Edith Finch as she explores the history of her family and tries to figure out why she's the last Finch left alive.",

Part of the game's strategy is managing the placement of tiles on the board to create routes for one's creatures to reach the opponent while limiting progress from the opponent.\n\nWinning games earns in-game currency that can be used to purchase new packs of cards, from which the player can then customize their deck. Support for the iOS and Android versions of the game were dropped in 2018 to focus on the PC version. The game also moved out of its free-to-play model and announced plans for card expansion DLCs around the same time.",

His apprenticeship as a stonemason paves his way to become a great architect. Soon, his steps lead him to Kingsbridge where he will build one of the greatest cathedrals England has ever seen. Aliena and Richard have to survive on their own, after the sibling's father, the Earl of Shiring, has been incarcerated and murdered. Aliena vows to make her brother the rightful heir and Earl of Shiring. Like Jack, their way leads them to Kingsbridge. Aliena puts her expertise as a tradeswoman to good use, supporting the cathedral's construction and falls in love with Jack. But Kingsbridge and its people are in grave danger. Philip's rivals, Bishop Waleran and Wiliam, a vengeful noble rejected by Aliena, see the town and its rise to importance as a thorn in their flesh. They want to see Kingsbridge burn.\n\nThe game-adaption of the world-bestseller \"The Pillars of the Earth\" is the first co-operative project of Daedalic Entertainment and Bastei Lübbe. This game will be more than just complementary media to the book and will instead retell the story in a new, interactive way. A team of about 20 people works to create a multi-platform adaption of this bestseller. The writers are also in contact and co-operation with the Follett Office and Ken Follett himself. Daedalic is the only studio at the time adapting such an epic reading-experience into an interactive format.\n\nThe game itself will be released in 2017, at the same time the third novel of the Kingsbridge-Series will be published. The game will be internationally available for PC, Mac, Linux, PS4, Xbox One and mobile devices.",

    "summary": "A remastered version of the 2012 release, Darksiders II.\n\nAwakened by the End of Days, Death, the most feared of the legendary Four Horsemen, embarks upon a quest to restore mankind, and redeem his brother's name. Along the way, the Horseman discovers that there are far worse things than an earthly Apocalypse, and that an ancient grudge may threaten all of Creation.\n\nDarksiders II follows the exploits of Death, one of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, in an action-packed tale that runs parallel to the events in the original Darksiders game. This epic journey propels Death across an expansive gameworld as he tries to redeem his brother, War, the horseman blamed for prematurely starting the Apocalypse in Darksiders.\n\nLike the original Darksiders game before it, the second iteration of the series is primarily a hack 'n slash adventure. The game takes place across netherworld environments, including 'The White city', an outpost where angels live, and 'The Eternal Throne', a floating fortress where the Lords of the Dead stand guard over souls that need to be cleansed. Although Death is the most feared of the Four Horsemen, his physical abilities are very different than his brother, War. Death is far more nimble, and relies on a combination of melee and ranged attacks. In combat Death's primary weapon is his huge iconic scythe, with a wide range of other weapons and usable items that must be gathered as the game progresses. Weapons can be dual-wielded, upgradable armor can be acquired for protection and Death has access to his terrifying and powerful mount, Despair.",

Patterns of lights executing a Danse Macabre on the walls is presented by a queer device on the table. Having recalled nothing other than that you’re in Upuaut, an Antarctic base located near south pole, you find the place deserted and have a distinct feeling of something being terribly wrong. Somehow knowing that your memories cannot guide you enforces a strange feeling of vulnerability, a familiar yet alien sensation of being a part of a peculiar whole... Soon you will discover that having used the device during the expedition, you have died but then returned subtly changed, speaking of strange memories and of strange places. You have lost something important or gained something sinister...\n\nExplore the antarctic base, as well as dreams and visions. Study clues, unlock secrets but avoid macabre beings at all cost.",

Newcomers will get the chance to experience one of the finest story-driven shooters of all time; an epic adventure combining gripping survival horror, exploration and tactical combat and stealth.\n\nThis definitive version also includes all previously released DLC, adding 10 hours of bonus single-player content to the huge solo campaign. Fans of the original game will notice new features and gameplay improvements, including new melee animations, the ability to check your watch and ammo supplies on the fly, and new full-body player animations.\n\nAnd those who favoured the more survival-horror oriented gameplay of the cult prequel ‘Metro 2033’ will find a new way to experience the campaign thanks to the introduction of two unique Play Styles – Survival and Spartan. The former transforms Last light from a more action-oriented stealth combat experience to a fraught, slow burn fight for survival. With the legendary Ranger Mode included to offer an extra layer of challenge and immersion, Metro: Last Light Redux offers hours of AAA gameplay for an incredible price.",

    "summary": "\"God’s Trigger is a fast paced, top-down, 3D action slasher where you, as a former army veteran and now a priest, begin your crusade against the evil of our times - gangs, drugs, human trafficking. You’re filled with God’s will to purify the world from its depravity. You are the hand of God and there will be no mercy for sinners!\n\nThe main and most unique gameplay mechanics in God’s Trigger is called Divine Focus and gives the player the ability to avoid bullets and tactically plan his attacks. The time is running normally for as long as the player keeps moving. As soon as Zoran stops though, the time slows down too. This allows the player to actually see bullets coming his way and in result avoid them. Even though the player can activate and deactivate Divine Focus whenever he wants, the ability has its limits. To refill its resource, the player needs to kill at least one enemy, without Divine Focus being activated.\n\nAnother feature important for how the gameplay evolves is a One Mistake rule which is really simple in its assumptions. Each hit is fatal for the main protagonist and means the game is over for the player.\n\nThe main reason behind introducing those two mechanics to the game, was to give players the opportunity to experience the joy of a pure, hardcore gameplay, with no place for mistakes. But in the same time, to give them a lot of freedom in clearing up the level and deciding how their play through will look like.\"",

Supraland assumes that you are intelligent and lets you play independently. The story is minimal, gives you an overarching goal to pursue, and then sets you free.\n\n– Metroidvania –\nYou explore a large interconnected world in which most ways are at first unpassable until you find new abilities to overcome those obstacles. A cornerstone of Supraland’s design was to create abilities that are so versatile, they will keep on surprising you by how many different usages they have. If you combine your abilities, the possibilities become even bigger.\n\n– Exploration –\nMost of the game is about exploring the sandbox world to track down secrets. Often you will think you are about to get out of bounds and beat the level designer, but right there is a chest waiting for you with a very rewarding upgrade. Supraland respects your lifetime and doesn’t bloat the playtime with unlimited no-brainer collectibles.\n\n– Puzzle Design –\nThe deeper you get into the game the more you will be facing creative puzzles you’ve never seen anywhere before, encouraging you to stop and think about what abilities you have and how you can use them in yet another way. Puzzle types that I already knew from other games were immediately rejected in the design process. And it’s important to me that once you understand the idea behind a puzzle, you can pretty much immediately solve it instead of having to go through a cumbersome, frustrating execution.\n\n– Fighting –\nThe fighting mechanics are inspired by old-school, fast-paced shooter games like Unreal, Doom and Quake, encouraging high-speed strafing and jumping while throwing shot after shot at hordes of charging enemies without ever having to worry about weapons reloading.",

    "summary": "Saints Row: The Third Remastered gives you control of the Saints at the height of their power, and you live the life to show for it. This is your City. These are your rules.\nRemastered with enhanced graphics, Steelport the original city of sin, has never looked so good as it drowns in sex, drugs and guns.\nYears after taking Stilwater for their own, the Third Street Saints have evolved from street gang to household brand name, with Saints sneakers, Saints energy drinks and Johnny Gat bobblehead dolls all available at a store near you. The Saints are kings of Stilwater, but their celebrity status has not gone unnoticed. The Syndicate, a legendary criminal fraternity with pawns in play all over the globe, has turned its eye on the Saints and demands tribute.\nRefusing to kneel to the Syndicate, you take the fight to Steelport, a once-proud metropolis reduced to a struggling city of sin under Syndicate control. Take a tank skydiving, call in a satellite-targeted airstrike on a Mexican wrestling gang, and fight against a highly-trained military force by your lonesome in the most outlandish gameplay scenarios ever seen.\nWeapons of Crass Destruction – It’s one thing to defeat your enemies. It’s another to humiliate them. Hover jets, human cannonball cars and outrageous melee weapons are all part of the fun.\nCrazy Character Customisation – Create the most outlandish characters ever seen, from washed-up celebrities to maskless ninja pirates. Inside every sinner, there is a Saint. Who will you become?\nOver The Top Co-op – Fly solo or play online with a homie. Give freefall skydiving a try, landing in your partner’s flaming pickup as you make a desperate run toward a heavily armed Syndicate base. Steelport is always more fun with a friend.\nAll DLC included – All three expansion mission packs and 30 pieces of DLC from the original version.",

    "summary": "A Game of Thrones: The Board Game – Digital Edition is the digital adaptation of the top-selling strategy board game from Fantasy Flight Games. During the game, players spread their influence across Westeros through a combination of strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and military might. As one of the Great Houses, will you conquer with force, forge alliances, rally your townsfolk, or cunningly coerce your way to the Iron Throne?\n\nBased on the best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones: The Board Game – Digital Edition allows up to six players to play online, or a single player with up to five AI opponents to play locally. The game is set after the death of King Robert Baratheon and allows each player to assume the role of one of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms in an attempt to assault King’s Landing and claim the Iron Throne.\n\nTo be declared ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, you have 10 rounds to use diplomacy and warfare to your advantage to control as many strategic areas of the map.\nConquer with care as your resources are scarce and your troops are not expendable. Muster your army, plan your orders wisely and seize strategical lands with your Footmen, Knights, Siege Engine and ships.\nDuring the turmoil of a battle, use well-known characters from your house to take the upper hand and vanquish your enemies.",

The village itself is an elaborate maze with no two iterations being precisely the same - you will have to explore and solve the mysteries of the game largely unguided. Die, and watch the village reconfigure itself into a new form. Solve puzzles and open shortcuts to new areas with tools and items you find along the way, unlocking every piece of the story with different characters, each suited for another aspect of exploration and investigation. With a limited supply of matches to light your way and darkness encroaching, can you find your way through the fog to reveal the truth? Or will you be engulfed by the secrets this town doesn’t want you to know?",

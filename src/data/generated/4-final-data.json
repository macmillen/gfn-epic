          "synopsis": "Fallout 3 is a action role-playing game set in the barren wasteland of a post-apocalyptic society. Players assume the role of a resident of an underground complex who emerges from a vault to explore a wastleland universe through a series of quests/missions. Mission objectives sometimes involve exploring various caves, sewers, and subway tunnels, while other quests involve combat with human and mutant survivors. Fighting can be frenetic and intense, highlighted by various camera effects (e.g., slow motion, blurring, screen shakes) and depictions of realistic dismemberment with trails of red blood. In one scene, players enter a black-and-white virtual reality simulation in which they use a kitchen knife to kill household members and pets. Characters are sometimes seen consuming fictional drugs (e.g., \"Buffout,\" \"Jet,\" and \"Mentats\"), while the player can also use – with no visual depiction of consuming/administering – a narcotic called \"psycho,\" which with repeated uses leads to addiction. A screen-blurring effect indicates the state of characters' intoxication and the need to use the narcotic to fend off various side effects. Several of the characters are prostitutes and the details of their sexual activities are mildly insinuated (e.g., \"You got the cash I got the time…I take care of men around here.\"). Strong profanity can also be heard throughout the game (e.g., \"f*ck,\" \"a*shole,\" and \"sh*t\").",

No two heroes are the same. Each hero has their own unique abilities and design, meaning there’s a hero to match everyone’s style of play. Heroes complete objectives to collect gold like killing minions, towers or enemy heroes. As a hero collects more gold they can buy items from the shop that influence their heroes in interesting ways - allowing them to teleport to new locations, go invisible, freeze time and more. Items also allow a hero to get more powerful by giving their hero better attributes such as power, attack speed, health and various other stats.\n\nUnlike most MOBAs, Predecessor puts you into the heart of the action. The Third-Person perspective fully immerses you into the game as enemies appear from shadow walls, over ledges or from behind you.",

From a 3/4-overhead perspective, players gather resources, build structures, and tend to inhabitants' health and wellbeing. During the course of the game, some settlers may die due to various environmental factors and ailments (e.g., disease/injuries, nuclear radiation poisoning, meteor strikes). Settlers may also perish due to players' choices (e.g., letting settlers brawl, allowing outsiders in, looting locals). In some instances, settlers may commit suicide if their needs are not met. Text descriptions and scenarios add to the dark tone of the game: Slavers with chained hostages in tow for trading purposes; “They can leave the colony, cause harm to themselves, or end their own lives by their own hand\"; a Burial Pit; frequent references to death; depictions of corpses.",

As players investigate and explore the mysterious environments, they use knives, pistols, shotguns, and explosives to kill human-like creatures and monsters. The frenetic combat is accompanied by screams of pain and realistic gunfire. Some attacks result in impalement and dismemberment/decapitation, with large blood-splatter effects; some environments also depict blood-splattered floors and mutilated bodies with exposed organs/viscera. Cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence: young characters burned alive; a man decapitated by a guillotine. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” can be heard in the dialogue. ",

Players can engage in diplomacy, manage resources, and make political decisions that affect their nation's statistics and overall strength. Players can also wage war on other nations; battles are depicted by two soldiers slashing swords or shooting rifles at each other—cries of pain and gunfire/clashing sounds can be heard. The game contains brief references to sexual material (e.g., “Her songs had countless instances of thinly-disguised innuendo and references to unconventional sex acts” and “…personal matters such as sexual intercourse . . .”). One passage references opium (e.g., “[U]nder the influence of an ever worsening and consuming opium addiction.”). The words “bastard” and “damn” appear in text.",

The collection includes Homeworld and Homeworld 2, painstakingly remastered by Gearbox in cooperation with key members of the original development team and members of the series’ passionate fan community. As a free bonus, this collection also includes the original versions of Homeworld and Homeworld 2 with compatibility updates, preserving the purest form of the original releases. Anyone who purchases Homeworld Remastered Collection will also receive free access to the Homeworld Remastered Steam Multiplayer Beta when the collection releases on February 25, 2015.\n\nThe Homeworld series has a long legacy and is regarded by many as one of the best strategy series of all time. Following its release in 1999 by publisher Sierra and developer Relic Entertainment, Homeworld received several Game of the Year awards and redefined the RTS genre. Its sequel, Homeworld 2, launched in 2003, and was similarly praised by critics for its innovative controls and changes to multiplayer. Brian Martel, Gearbox Software's Chief Creative Officer, has great love and respect for Relic's brilliant, fun and innovative franchise and personally spearheaded Gearbox Software’s acquisition of Homeworld from THQ in 2013.",

          "synopsis": "This is a multiplayer online role-playing game in which players assume the role of a warrior in the fantastical world of Nirn. As players explore open-world environments, they can perform various quests and complete tasks. Characters use swords, arrows, axes, and magic attacks (e.g., lightning, fire attacks) to kill human-like and fantastical enemies (e.g., orcs, demons, giant insects). Players engage in melee-style combat, hacking and slashing at various enemies; battles are highlighted by cries of pain, impact sounds, and blood splashes. Some sequences depict large amounts of blood streaming up-close as vampires attack/feed on characters. In some quests players have the ability to mount creatures' severed heads onto pikes; some environments depict corpse piles or skeletons hanging from torture devices. Text descriptions or dialogue sometimes contain references to sexual material and/or innuendo (e.g., “She...raped the men as cruelly as Bal had ravished her”; “In his mind, she would be the sheath to every knight's blade”; “No sweetmeat for you”; But it is huge! It could take me all night!”). During the course of the game, alcohol (i.e., wine, mead, ale) can be purchased and consumed by the central character; one sequence prompts players to engage in a drinking contest, resulting in the central character's blurred vision/slurred speech.",

When characters are hit, they recoil and let out brief cries, as their health bar reduces. When an enemy character is defeated, they fall to the ground and remain in view until the end of the level. When player characters are defeated, they also fall to the ground but can be revived by a team member. The game also includes infrequent use of bad language ('shit', 'bastard' and 'piss').",

Players traverse a modern city and earn skill points and experience on their way to becoming elite criminals. Players use pistols, machine guns, and sniper rifles to shoot and kill various human characters; some of these characters include police and SWAT team members. Players have the ability to shoot random civilians, but there is a penalty for doing so. Violence is highlighted by realistic gunfire, cries of pain, and large blood-splatter effects. During the course of the game, some paintings and drawings depict women in suggestive poses and/or revealing outfits. Some missions require interaction with drugs: in one mission, players cook and defend batches of methamphetamine (“meth”); another mission requires players to guard and transport large bags of cocaine. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” appear in the dialogue.",

Missions allow players to explore the Mojave Desert, surrounding casinos, and abandoned facilities; other quests involve combat with human and mutant survivors. Players use chainsaws, laser rifles, knives, and sledgehammers to kill enemies. Fighting can be frenetic and intense, highlighted by various camera effects (e.g., slow motion, blurring, screen shakes) and depictions of dismemberment, blood spray, and blood trails. In one sequence, players can choose to activate a collar bomb around a slave-woman's neck, resulting in depictions of blood and gore. During the course of the game, players will encounter male and female prostitutes: the screen fades to black as suggestive dialogue is heard in the background (e.g., \"Nice charlies, too! Give them a shake for the Ben-man, will ya?\"); there is also an extended sequence suggesting (no depiction) sexual activity with a robot (e.g., \"Fisto reporting for duty . . . Please assume the position,\"\"I suppose I should test you out . . . Servos active!\" and \"Something wrong with someone if they got to f**k a machine.\"). The storyline sometimes references a fictional drug called \"chems,\" as well as \"Day Trippers,\"\"cracked out junkies,\" and \"degenerate, drug-addicted killers.\" Players' Character can be seen consuming the drugs, which sometimes leads to a screen-blurring effect.",

As players traverse mountainous terrain, they can be attacked by human settlers and ghostly apparitions. Players use machine guns, grenades, and shotguns to kill enemies; firefights are highlighted by realistic gunfire, large splashes of blood, and cries of pain. Cutscenes contain more intense instances of violence: a man and an infant shot—the latter, accidentally (blood splatter appears below the infant); a character shooting a comatose patient in the head; a man stabbing himself repeatedly in the distance. A handful of scenes depict a character with his buttocks exposed. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” appear in the dialogue.",

Nearly 40 Alaska Native elders, storytellers and community members contributed to the development of the game.\n\nIt features two characters, and it can be played in single-player mode or play cooperatively with a friend as you trek through frozen tundra, leap across treacherous ice floes, swim through underwater caverns and face enemies both strange and familiar.\n\nYou'll explore awe-inspiring environments, perform heroic deeds and meet legendary characters from Iñupiaq stories — all narrated by a master storyteller in the spoken Iñupiaq language.",

At night, the hunter becomes the hunted, as the infected become aggressive and more dangerous. Most frightening are the predators which only appear after sundown.

Players can traverse the open-world environment and attack hordes of zombies to complete mission objectives. Players use axes, machetes, rifles and tools (e.g., firecrackers and Molotov cocktails) to kill enemies in frenetic melee-style combat. Red blood-splatter effects occur frequently; large blood stains can be seen in the environment. Enemies often get dismembered and decapitated during combat; a handful of sequences depict mutilated bodies with exposed organs/viscera. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” can be heard in the dialogue.",

Players use swords/knives, ranged weapons, explosives, and supernatural powers to kill enemy soldiers and thugs in frenetic combat. Enemies can be shot with spikes, stabbed in the head or chest, and slashed to death—resulting in large blood-splatter effects. Some attacks allow players to dismember or decapitate enemies; grenades and trap mines can blow enemies up into bursts of blood and limbs. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” appear in the dialogue.",

As players help Corvo exact revenge on those who betrayed him, they can use pistols, crossbows, swords, and grenades to kill human enemies in ranged and melee-style combat. Violence is sometimes accompanied by slow-motion effects and gurgling sounds from Corvo's victims. Certain weapons result in dismembered limbs, and attacks are accompanied by exaggerated blood-splatter effects. Some environments depict mutilated corpses on the ground or hanging from the ceiling. During one interactive sequence, Corvo brands a restrained man's cheek with a hot iron; in another, players use electric shocks to interrogate a blindfolded man in a chair. The game depicts some female characters in revealing outfits and includes some sexual/suggestive dialogue (e.g., “Hey sweetheart, you want to play with me? You're a lot cuter than my regulars,” “This one thinks only of whores,” and “Sell your wife into prostitution, I'm sure I can get you a good price.”). The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” can also be heard in the game.",

          "synopsis": "This is an action role-playing game, set in a medieval fantasy world, in which players assume the role of an alien humanoid searching for a special nectar from other beings. From a third-person perspective, players explore crypts, dungeons, and haunted forests to battle humanoids and fantastical creatures (e.g., ogres, feral cave dwellers). Players use swords, war hammers, and axes to attack and kill enemies in melee-style combat. Battles are accompanied by sword slashing sounds, screams of pain, and blood-splatter effects. A handful of sequences contain more dramatic depictions of blood and gore: an enemy removing its head and throwing it at a man; characters reaching in and pulling out organs from creatures' bodies; a close-up of a humanoid slowly removing bloody swords from its chest. Some environments depict large blood stains on the ground, and one area depicts a large pool of blood-like liquid.",

As players traverse mountainous terrain, they can be attacked by human settlers and ghostly apparitions. Players use machine guns, grenades, and shotguns to kill enemies; firefights are highlighted by realistic gunfire, large splashes of blood, and cries of pain. Cutscenes contain more intense instances of violence: a man and an infant shot—the latter, accidentally (blood splatter appears below the infant); a character shooting a comatose patient in the head; a man stabbing himself repeatedly in the distance. A handful of scenes depict a character with his buttocks exposed. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” appear in the dialogue.",

      "summary": "Metro: Last Light Redux is the definitive version of the critically acclaimed ‘Metro: Last Light’, rebuilt in the latest and greatest iteration of the 4A Engine for Next Gen. Newcomers will get the chance to experience one of the finest story-driven shooters of all time; an epic adventure combining gripping survival horror, exploration and tactical combat and stealth.\n\nThis definitive version also includes all previously released DLC, adding 10 hours of bonus single-player content to the huge solo campaign. Fans of the original game will notice new features and gameplay improvements, including new melee animations, the ability to check your watch and ammo supplies on the fly, and new full-body player animations.\n\nAnd those who favoured the more survival-horror oriented gameplay of the cult prequel ‘Metro 2033’ will find a new way to experience the campaign thanks to the introduction of two unique Play Styles – Survival and Spartan. The former transforms Last light from a more action-oriented stealth combat experience to a fraught, slow burn fight for survival. With the legendary Ranger Mode included to offer an extra layer of challenge and immersion, Metro: Last Light Redux offers hours of AAA gameplay for an incredible price.",

The game utilizes a health system in which players' health is divided into separate sections that regenerate; if an entire section is lost, the player must use a health pack to replenish the missing health. In combat, a cover system can be used as assistance against enemies. The player have the ability to lean around, over, and under cover, which can be used as a tactical advantage during shootouts and stealth levels. The game gives the player a wide variety of weapon options—they can be found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or removed from their stationary position and carried around.",

          "synopsis": "This is a first-person shooter in which players assume the role of a US Army Ranger as he battles Nazi forces between 1946 and 1960. Players use pistols, machine guns, sniper rifles, fantasy weapons, and explosives to kill enemy soldiers and robotic characters. Players can also sneak up on enemies, stab them repeatedly, or slash their throats with a knife. Some weapons allow players to blow up enemies, resulting in chunks of flesh/blood strewn around game environments; large robots/mech suits sometimes crush enemies' heads or bodies. A handful of sequences depict bodies incinerated/mutilated by torture devices. During the course of the game, characters sometimes engage in sexual activity (e.g., a man thrusting against a woman on a table; a woman gyrating on top of a man in bed—camera angles largely obscure the sex act and no nudity is depicted.). The game includes a sequence in which two characters ingest a hallucinogenic drug from a liquid dropper; the screen becomes blurry and distorted. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” appear in the dialogue.",

As a New Republic pilot, players fly x-wings and other ships in order to protect/escort allies and civilians, and engage with enemies (e.g., Imperial tie fighters, destroyers, space stations). As an Imperial pilot, players launch assaults on civilian/refugee ships, destroy fuel depots, attack medical frigates, and engage in frenetic combat with Republic forces. The frenetic combat takes place from a first-person perspective, as players use lasers, missiles, and bombs to destroy enemies. Space battles are highlighted by frequent gunfire/blaster fire, radio chatter, and large explosions. The word “bastard” appears in the dialogue.",

As demonic forces, players must kill human survivors by setting traps and controlling demonic minions and inanimate objects (e.g., trucks, trees). Battles are frenetic, often accompanied by large blood-splatter effects that leave stains on characters and the environment. Some survivors can perform finishing attacks that result in dismemberment, decapitation, and/or disembowelment of enemies. When controlling demonic minions, players can rip their minion's arm and/or head off to use as a weapon against opponents. Some demonic creatures are depicted partially nude with exposed buttocks and/or breasts. The word “sh*t” is heard in the game, and a handful of characters are shown raising their middle fingers.",

      "summary": "Saturnalia is a survival-horror adventure inspired and heavily influenced by the folklore of Sardinia, Italy, a region rich with unique traditions and culture. You play as four characters, experiencing a deeply connected storyline that ties back to the haunting traditions of this ancient village. The village itself is an elaborate maze with no two iterations being precisely the same - you will have to explore and solve the mysteries of the game largely unguided. Die, and watch the village reconfigure itself into a new form. Solve puzzles and open shortcuts to new areas with tools and items you find along the way, unlocking every piece of the story with different characters, each suited for another aspect of exploration and investigation. With a limited supply of matches to light your way and darkness encroaching, can you find your way through the fog to reveal the truth? Or will you be engulfed by the secrets this town doesn’t want you to know?",

Prepare for the future.\n\nThe third game in the Fallout series, Fallout 3 is a singleplayer action role-playing game (RPG) set in a post-apocalyptic Washington DC. Combining the horrific insanity of the Cold War era theory of mutually assured destruction gone terribly wrong, with the kitschy naivety of American 1950s nuclear propaganda, Fallout 3 will satisfy both players familiar with the popular first two games in its series as well as those coming to the franchise for the first time.",

          "synopsis": "Fallout 3 is a action role-playing game set in the barren wasteland of a post-apocalyptic society. Players assume the role of a resident of an underground complex who emerges from a vault to explore a wastleland universe through a series of quests/missions. Mission objectives sometimes involve exploring various caves, sewers, and subway tunnels, while other quests involve combat with human and mutant survivors. Fighting can be frenetic and intense, highlighted by various camera effects (e.g., slow motion, blurring, screen shakes) and depictions of realistic dismemberment with trails of red blood. In one scene, players enter a black-and-white virtual reality simulation in which they use a kitchen knife to kill household members and pets. Characters are sometimes seen consuming fictional drugs (e.g., \"Buffout,\" \"Jet,\" and \"Mentats\"), while the player can also use – with no visual depiction of consuming/administering – a narcotic called \"psycho,\" which with repeated uses leads to addiction. A screen-blurring effect indicates the state of characters' intoxication and the need to use the narcotic to fend off various side effects. Several of the characters are prostitutes and the details of their sexual activities are mildly insinuated (e.g., \"You got the cash I got the time…I take care of men around here.\"). Strong profanity can also be heard throughout the game (e.g., \"f*ck,\" \"a*shole,\" and \"sh*t\").",

Platforms and obstacles appear and disappear as the background colour changes, so if you can’t see something, it doesn’t exist. Whether you're playing alone or with friends, Runbow is fast, frantic, and a lot of fun.\n\nPlayers can race against each other in The Runbow Run, or go head to head in a number of different modes including King of the Hill and Arena to name a few. Use the Wii U GamePad to become the malevolent ColourMaster controlling the colours and the obstacles in the level, or tackle our toughest game mode, The Bowhemoth, a 30+ minute platforming challenge that will put the patience and skill of even the toughest players to the test.\n\nIf dozens of game modes, hundreds of unlockable costumes, and a crazy, colourful gaming challenge sounds like fun, then you better get ready to Runbow!",

During the course of the game, animals and human characters can be seen defecating, leaving balls of feces on the ground; flatulence sounds can be heard throughout the game.

Play as an ordinary red fox who’s story becomes entwined with the guardian of the Northern Lights, a female spirit fox. As you journey over the mountains and under red stained skies you’ll discover more about your companion and a land left in ruin.\"",

Gameplay consists of assembling ingredients into international dishes and serving them to customers. Rival food trucks can attempt to disable players' truck by bumping against it, blocking exits, and/or shooting at it. While no characters are injured, realistic machine gunfire sounds accompany the shooting attacks. Some dishes include alcoholic beverages (e.g., wine, rum, brandy) in ingredient lists.",

During the game, players spread their influence across Westeros through a combination of strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and military might. As one of the Great Houses, will you conquer with force, forge alliances, rally your townsfolk, or cunningly coerce your way to the Iron Throne?\n\nBased on the best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones: The Board Game – Digital Edition allows up to six players to play online, or a single player with up to five AI opponents to play locally. The game is set after the death of King Robert Baratheon and allows each player to assume the role of one of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms in an attempt to assault King’s Landing and claim the Iron Throne.\n\nTo be declared ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, you have 10 rounds to use diplomacy and warfare to your advantage to control as many strategic areas of the map.\nConquer with care as your resources are scarce and your troops are not expendable. Muster your army, plan your orders wisely and seize strategical lands with your Footmen, Knights, Siege Engine and ships.\nDuring the turmoil of a battle, use well-known characters from your house to take the upper hand and vanquish your enemies.",

From a third-person perspective, players explore oceans, eat sea creatures, and attack boats and humans. The players' shark attacks by diving, biting, and/or slashing its tail at prey, resulting in large splatters/mists of blood. Some areas prompt players to kill a certain number of beachgoers or hunters in order to progress; other levels contain one-on-one battles against rival sharks. Cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence: a shark leaping onto a boat to bite off a man's arm; a shark biting off a man's leg; a bloodied man stabbing a shark while being chewed on. Voiceovers/dialogue contains some mature humor (jokes about defecation, urination), including sexual material (e.g., “My grandfather called a vagina 'the little man in a canoe'\"; “...they enjoy a steady diet of hypodermic needles and used pregnancy tests”; “The nettle's tentacles can be quite alluring to curious predators… or jellyfish fetishists.”). Text includes references to drugs such as heroin, cocaine, marijuana, and fentanyl. The game contains several partially bleeped/censored words such as \"f**k\" and \"sh*t\"; there are also words in Cajun French that translate to \"f**k you\" and \"sh*t\" (e.g., \"p*c k*e toi,\" \"m*rde\").",

It is the semi-sequel to 2009's Wolfenstein, however utilizes very little from the game and drops any direct references to veil or supernatural.\n\nTo progress through the story, the player battle enemies throughout levels. The game utilizes a health system in which players' health is divided into separate sections that regenerate; if an entire section is lost, the player must use a health pack to replenish the missing health. In combat, a cover system can be used as assistance against enemies. The player have the ability to lean around, over, and under cover, which can be used as a tactical advantage during shootouts and stealth levels. The game gives the player a wide variety of weapon options—they can be found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or removed from their stationary position and carried around.",

Players use pistols, machine guns, sniper rifles, fantasy weapons, and explosives to kill enemy soldiers and robotic characters. Players can also sneak up on enemies, stab them repeatedly, or slash their throats with a knife. Some weapons allow players to blow up enemies, resulting in chunks of flesh/blood strewn around game environments; large robots/mech suits sometimes crush enemies' heads or bodies. A handful of sequences depict bodies incinerated/mutilated by torture devices. During the course of the game, characters sometimes engage in sexual activity (e.g., a man thrusting against a woman on a table; a woman gyrating on top of a man in bed—camera angles largely obscure the sex act and no nudity is depicted.). The game includes a sequence in which two characters ingest a hallucinogenic drug from a liquid dropper; the screen becomes blurry and distorted. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” appear in the dialogue.",

          "synopsis": "This is a collection of three first-person shooters in which players assume the role of characters uncovering the mysteries behind the dystopian societies of Rapture and Columbia. As players explore each city, they use shotguns, machine guns, rivet guns, and rocket launchers to kill mutated citizens and enemy soldiers. Players can also use special powers (e.g., telekinesis, fire blasts, electric bolts) to kill enemies as well as a three-pronged hook to dismember and decapitate them. Large blood-splatter effects occur as enemies are injured; pools of blood can be seen around corpses. Cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence: characters shot in the head at close range; a woman smothered to death with a pillow; a man impaled by a drill; a character nearly lobotomized with surgical tools. The game references sexual material in the dialogue (e.g., “I think yeh gave me the clap, ya dirty boy,” “Gonorrhea! That's what you'll get,” and “Sexual intimacy is no different from any other commodity friend. You sell soybeans I sell companionship.”). During the course of the game, players can consume alcoholic beverages, resulting in a screen-blurring effect; a handful of scenes depict children smoking cigarettes. The social/political backdrop of one fictional city (set in the year 1912) includes the use of derogatory ethnic/racial terms (e.g., the words \"gook,\" \"chink,\" \"negroes,\" \"injuns,\" \"crackers\"); language such as “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “c*nt” can also be heard.",

          "synopsis": "This is a first-person shooter in which players assume the role of a Vault Hunter engaging in combat missions while traversing through planets on foot and in vehicles. Players explore new planets, interact with characters, and accept missions to kill specific enemies or obtain objects/information. Players use pistols, machine guns, shotguns, grenade launchers, and explosives to kill enemies in frenetic combat. Battles are highlighted by realistic gunfire, cries of pain, and frequent blood-splatter effects. Some weapons cause enemies to explode into blood sprays and body parts. Stylized environments depict further instances of violence and gore: severed heads on spikes; a human corpse on a spit fire; a giant grinder emitting body parts and blood; a birthday cake decorated with severed fingers. The game contains some sexual material, mostly in the dialogue (e.g., “Looks like someone won't be getting a pre-coital foot rub”; “...I wasn't always the smokin' hot six-stroke sex engine I am today”; “I'm talkin' sex stuff! Two rounds if I've got the juice.”). The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” appear in dialogue.",

Realistic gunfire, large explosions, and blood-splatter effects occur during combat. Some environments depict large blood stains and corpses amid pools of blood. A handful of sequences depict additional acts of violence: a character executed with a gunshot to the head; a man impaled by alien tentacles at close range. During the course of the game, players' character can consume alcohol, resulting in a drunkenness status (e.g., screen-blurring effect, stumbling). The word “sh*t” is heard in the dialogue.",

From a first-person perspective, players explore a desert and the ruins of an alien civilization while fending off ghouls that stalk both worlds. Ghouls and human characters occasionally attack Tasi by grabbing, punching, or hitting her with stones. Bloodstains are seen on or around corpses, one of which appears headless. Some sequences depict characters (one, a nude man) strapped into torture devices, menaced by blades or probes; though no torture is seen, audio of fleshy sounds, mechanical whirring, and screams of pain are heard. Cutscenes also contain instances of intense violence: a character repeatedly smashing a man's head onto a staircase; a ghoul's arm breaking off during a struggle. Zombie characters are occasionally depicted nude, with realistic breasts/genitalia. The word “f**k” appears in the dialogue.",

Another notable scene shows a man's head being repeatedly slammed into steps as he pleads for the attacker to stop. Blood pools on the steps with every hit until his body falls limp and he dies.

Players use rifles, machine guns, pistols, and grenades to kill enemies (e.g., human-, insect-, beast-like characters) in turn-based combat. Attack moves occur in brief cutscenes that depict characters getting shot or wounded/killed by explosions. Splashes and pools of yellow and red blood sometimes appear when characters are injured or killed. During the course of the game, players can customize soldiers with accessories, including lit cigarettes and cigars.",

Confront the differing terrains as a lonely mountaineer and make your way through Ice, Snow and Stone. Use items to keep up your steadily sinking stats, while making your way up and down the insurmountable heights. The dynamic and ever-changing weather system, the day-night cycles, and numerous other events will make sure that you meet tough challenges on your journey to the top.\n\nTo live up to these challenges, you are able to improve your character. By earning experience points through events, you can choose skills to help you with certain playstyles. One of the serveral roguelike elements is permadeath, which forces you to try various strategies in your pursuit to summit the mountain.\n\nThe game focuses, on the one hand, on the decisions you make in a risky environment full of uncertainties, on the other hand, on evoking intense emotions people experience in such a harsh and savage environment.",

Players can encounter the dead bodies of other climbers, or be told that a climber, including the player's character, has been injured. There are no graphic images of injury but text descriptions do refer to climbers being in pain, bleeding or being fearful. Such events may also be accompanied by a suspenseful soundtrack. Some of the routes feature eerie surroundings, in which the player is told they are being followed by sounds and noises, although nothing is visually depicted. If players run out of health, oxygen or body temperature, they may collapse, although this is not shown visually. Instead, the game will show a figure lying in the snow and explain what happened, after which the player can set out on a new journey.",

Players command a variety of races and factions while managing diplomatic policies and military/technological development. From a top-down perspective, players can arrange human soldiers and fantasy creatures (e.g., skeletal infantry, wizards, giants) on the battlefield and observe them in combat. Battles are highlighted by sword slashes, explosions, and cries of pain. A handful of cutscenes depict blood-stained weapons; vials of blood can also be seen in the background. The words “bastard\" and “ar*e” appear in the dialogue. Online Interactions Not Rated by the ESRB (Windows PC)",

The player progresses by manipulating the two brothers at the same time to complete various puzzles, often requiring the player to manipulate both brothers to perform differing functions (such as one distracting a hostile non-player character while the other makes their way around).\n\nShould either brother fall from a great height or get injured, the game restarts at a recent checkpoint. All of the in-game dialogue is spoken in a fictional language, thus the story is conveyed through actions, gestures and expressions.",

Players learn vampire skills/abilities; track citizens as potential prey; and battle other vampires, ghouls, and vampire hunters in frenetic combat. Characters mostly use swords or guns to attack enemies; Jonathan can also rip out the throats of human enemies by stalking and biting them. Some sequences depict executions of characters on and off-screen—a man's decapitated head appears on the ground in one off-screen killing. Blood-splatter effects occur frequently, and some environments depict mutilated corpses covered in blood. The game includes some sexual material: references to a priest molesting a child; a prostitute soliciting a character on the street (e.g., “Pay me a glass and I'll be gentle…Pay me a bottle, and I'll be nasty...I promise I'm cheap and clean.”). During the course of the game, a character is depicted slapping his arm for a vein, then injecting himself with a drug off-screen (\"that is better...I will make it through one more night.\"). The words “f**k” and “sh*t” appear in the dialogue. ",

Damage to a character is shown via a health bar, when this has expired it will fall to the ground and disappear. All of the antagonists in the game carry a weapon, bladed or projectile firing, that can be used against the player’s character and team members, when hit the character will grunt and recoil from the effects but will continue to fight, the violence is realistic-looking. There are no blood effects and when the player’s character dies the game will restart from the last checkpoint. Game also contains the word \"fuck\".",

As players traverse fictional Chinese villages and towns, they interact with characters and engage in barehanded street fighting against enemy thugs and gang members. Players use punches, kicks, and throws to defeat enemies; fights are accompanied by impact sounds and cries of pain. Some female characters wear outfits with low cut tops that reveal large amounts of cleavage; dialogue and text also reference suggestive material (e.g., “I pray my hubby gains some pep to his step...in bed”; “Whoa, check out the pair on that one”; “The scumbags trying to extort money from any shop owner with boobs.”). As players progress through the game, they can wager in-game currency on dice games, animal races, and roulette-style games. Several characters can be seen smoking cigarettes and drinking from beer bottles and jugs of wine. The words “a*s,” “b*tch,” and “pr*ck” are heard in the game.",

Players construct facilities, manage staff, and monitor the daily events/operations of prison inmates, including breaking up fights, searching for contraband. From a top-down perspective, prison inmates (depicted as \"cartoony\" wood pegs) are sometimes seen fighting each other as well as guards; large splashes of blood appear and remain on the ground. Players also view cutscenes containing narratives about select prisoners; these cutscenes include comic-book still images of violent acts and depictions of blood (e.g., gunshot wounds; stabbings; bound hostages; murder victims). One prolonged sequence depicts a hostage situation in which prison staff members can be hurt and killed by inmates. One cutscene depicts still images of a man and a woman partially nude in bed; moaning sounds can be heard. The game contains a handful of drug references: inmates smuggling drugs; still images of cocaine. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” appear in the dialogue.",

As the killer, players must find the survivors, from a first-person perspective, before they escape each level. Killers can use various weapons (e.g., chainsaws, cattle hammers, bone saws) and/or hang survivors on meat hooks around levels to kill them. Killers can also perform various finishing attacks (e.g., throat ripping, disemboweling, chainsaw impalement) to kill wounded survivors; in rare instances, red chunks of flesh are depicted during death animations.

Nearly 40 Alaska Native elders, storytellers and community members contributed to the development of the game.\n\nIt features two characters, and it can be played in single-player mode or play cooperatively with a friend as you trek through frozen tundra, leap across treacherous ice floes, swim through underwater caverns and face enemies both strange and familiar.\n\nYou'll explore awe-inspiring environments, perform heroic deeds and meet legendary characters from Iñupiaq stories — all narrated by a master storyteller in the spoken Iñupiaq language.",

Players can engage in diplomacy, manage resources, and make political decisions that affect their nation's statistics and overall strength. Players can also wage war on other nations; battles are depicted by two soldiers slashing swords or shooting rifles at each other—cries of pain and gunfire/clashing sounds can be heard. The game contains brief references to sexual material (e.g., “Her songs had countless instances of thinly-disguised innuendo and references to unconventional sex acts” and “…personal matters such as sexual intercourse . . .”). One passage references opium (e.g., “[U]nder the influence of an ever worsening and consuming opium addiction.”). The words “bastard” and “damn” appear in text.",

The hardship, the hunger, the thirst. The fear. You keep reminding yourself why you stay alive. Why you do this. Then you hear it. “Daddy, you’re back.” You wife’s face lights up and you open a bag full of medical supplies. You need not tell her how you got them. You simply enjoy your small victory in this, the harshest of times. In the post-apocalyptic world, you must keep your family alive in your underground bunker in this deep strategy game from Unicube…\n\nSheltered is a post-apocalyptic disaster management game that gives a whole new meaning to the term “nuclear family”. Given a head-start over the billions lost in a nuclear holocaust, you must gather as many supplies as possible en route to the concrete underground shelter that will soon become your family home for the foreseeable dreary future.\n\nWith all hope lost, how will you cope in this bleak new world? How you handle the many moral choices you’ll encounter on a daily basis could be the difference between your family surviving or dying. Combat claustrophobia, radiation and mental exhaustion as you cling desperately to life in the cramp, cold and scary underground shelter. You’ll have to leave the scant protection the shelter offers behind as you’re forced to venture outside into the dangerous desolate wasteland to scavenge for vital supplies which could ensure your family’s survival for just one more day.",

These are your rules.\nRemastered with enhanced graphics, Steelport the original city of sin, has never looked so good as it drowns in sex, drugs and guns.\nYears after taking Stilwater for their own, the Third Street Saints have evolved from street gang to household brand name, with Saints sneakers, Saints energy drinks and Johnny Gat bobblehead dolls all available at a store near you. The Saints are kings of Stilwater, but their celebrity status has not gone unnoticed. The Syndicate, a legendary criminal fraternity with pawns in play all over the globe, has turned its eye on the Saints and demands tribute.\nRefusing to kneel to the Syndicate, you take the fight to Steelport, a once-proud metropolis reduced to a struggling city of sin under Syndicate control. Take a tank skydiving, call in a satellite-targeted airstrike on a Mexican wrestling gang, and fight against a highly-trained military force by your lonesome in the most outlandish gameplay scenarios ever seen.\nWeapons of Crass Destruction – It’s one thing to defeat your enemies. It’s another to humiliate them. Hover jets, human cannonball cars and outrageous melee weapons are all part of the fun.\nCrazy Character Customisation – Create the most outlandish characters ever seen, from washed-up celebrities to maskless ninja pirates. Inside every sinner, there is a Saint. Who will you become?\nOver The Top Co-op – Fly solo or play online with a homie. Give freefall skydiving a try, landing in your partner’s flaming pickup as you make a desperate run toward a heavily armed Syndicate base. Steelport is always more fun with a friend.\nAll DLC included – All three expansion mission packs and 30 pieces of DLC from the original version.",

From a third-person perspective, players avoid swarms of rats and use stealth tactics to sneak around soldiers. One method of deterring rats is to lure them to corpses or soldiers, who are shown screaming as they are bitten/eaten. Cutscenes depict characters being impaled by swords, struck by arrows or maces, and stabbed by spears. Some game environments contain corpses that have been impaled, burned, or partially eaten/mutilated (sometimes with entrails visible). The words “f**k” and “sh*t” appear in the dialogue.",

A handful of still images depict patients or corpses covered by bloodstained sheets. During the course of the game, a pub can employ prostitutes and be turned into a “House of Pleasure” with the accompanying text: “Our hard-working people deserve all the relief we can provide, and some of them yearn for the pleasures of flesh.” The word “f**k” appears in the text.",

Content specific issues There are scenes of mild violence involving cartoon-like characters inside space suits. The violence is non-realistic, as are the reactions to the violence. Other issues This game offers players the opportunity to purchase additional content, such as new maps, outfits and pets. Some parents or carers may want to be aware of this. Parents, carers or other responsible adults should check to see what is being offered before making any purchase on behalf of a child. It should be noted that the game can still be played without the need to purchase such items.",

From a first-person perspective, players explore the station's rooms and corridors and use shotguns, pistols, bombs, and flamethrowers to kill alien creatures; androids can be dispatched by being shot, set on fire, or blown up. When Ripley is spotted by an alien, a short cutscene depicts her getting knocked down and bitten in the face, or stabbed through the chest with a spike. Blood is depicted when players are impaled; several corpses can be seen lying in pools of blood during the course of the game. The words “f**k,” and “sh*t” appear in the dialogue.",

      "summary": "England, 12th century: Philip the monk becomes Prior of the small abbey of Kingsbridge. At the same time, a boy called Jack is raised by his outlawed mother in the woods. His apprenticeship as a stonemason paves his way to become a great architect. Soon, his steps lead him to Kingsbridge where he will build one of the greatest cathedrals England has ever seen. Aliena and Richard have to survive on their own, after the sibling's father, the Earl of Shiring, has been incarcerated and murdered. Aliena vows to make her brother the rightful heir and Earl of Shiring. Like Jack, their way leads them to Kingsbridge. Aliena puts her expertise as a tradeswoman to good use, supporting the cathedral's construction and falls in love with Jack. But Kingsbridge and its people are in grave danger. Philip's rivals, Bishop Waleran and Wiliam, a vengeful noble rejected by Aliena, see the town and its rise to importance as a thorn in their flesh. They want to see Kingsbridge burn.\n\nThe game-adaption of the world-bestseller \"The Pillars of the Earth\" is the first co-operative project of Daedalic Entertainment and Bastei Lübbe. This game will be more than just complementary media to the book and will instead retell the story in a new, interactive way. A team of about 20 people works to create a multi-platform adaption of this bestseller. The writers are also in contact and co-operation with the Follett Office and Ken Follett himself. Daedalic is the only studio at the time adapting such an epic reading-experience into an interactive format.\n\nThe game itself will be released in 2017, at the same time the third novel of the Kingsbridge-Series will be published. The game will be internationally available for PC, Mac, Linux, PS4, Xbox One and mobile devices.",

Players explore environments and interact with characters to influence the progression of the story. A handful of scenes depict brief instances of violence: a man stabbed through the chest with a spear; a man's throat getting slit, as blood splashes appear. Blood is also depicted in a childbirth scene (no nudity shown), and during a hunting sequence. The game includes some sexual material in the dialogue (e.g.,“I will f**k Bartholomew's wh*re of a daughter. I will f**k her good.”); one scene depicts a still image of a man grabbing a woman by the shoulders, accompanied by the text “He shoved his right hand under her skirt.”",

Cultivate your own food, mine minerals or just relax by the bar after a hard day’s work. Most important of all, though, is keeping your colonists alive. Not an easy task on a strange new planet.",

Players mine resources (e.g., fuel, rare metals, water), build dome structures, and manage inhabitants' needs along the way. Characters may die of malnutrition or commit suicide if their “sanity” levels fall too low; this is conveyed mostly through text, as inhabitants are simply depicted collapsing and lying on the ground after death. Players can also construct turrets to defend their bases from rival corporations' attacks; missiles and explosions accompany these brief attack sequences. Colonists have a variety of character traits that affect their productivity, including alcoholism; text briefly references alcohol addiction (e.g., “We all find our own ways to cope with this pressure. Tsvetan Hasanov finds it in the bottle.”). The word \"hell\" appears in text.",

Action is highlighted by realistic gunfire, explosions, and screams of pain. Large blood-splatter effects occur frequently, and several weapons cause enemies to explode into chunks of flesh; some weapons can also result in decapitations. One scene requires players to search for an item amid a corpse's entrails. Game text contains some suggestive/sexual material (e.g., “[H]e's just standing over there...stroking his shorts like that, smiling...”; \"A d*ck's not that big when it's empty of, you know, blood, right? How you gonna choke on that?“; “[H]is underground gas-dungeon—a place where he also produces his sex tapes, tortures people...”). The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “c*mguzzler” appear in the dialogue.",

Newcomers will get the chance to experience one of the finest story-driven shooters of all time; an epic adventure combining gripping survival horror, exploration and tactical combat and stealth.\n\nThis definitive version also includes all previously released DLC, adding 10 hours of bonus single-player content to the huge solo campaign. Fans of the original game will notice new features and gameplay improvements, including new melee animations, the ability to check your watch and ammo supplies on the fly, and new full-body player animations.\n\nAnd those who favoured the more survival-horror oriented gameplay of the cult prequel ‘Metro 2033’ will find a new way to experience the campaign thanks to the introduction of two unique Play Styles – Survival and Spartan. The former transforms Last light from a more action-oriented stealth combat experience to a fraught, slow burn fight for survival. With the legendary Ranger Mode included to offer an extra layer of challenge and immersion, Metro: Last Light Redux offers hours of AAA gameplay for an incredible price.",

From an overhead perspective, players navigate a grid-based map to explore dungeons and engage enemies in combat. Players use axes, bows, and magic spells to defeat enemy creatures (e.g., golems, skeletons, goblins) in turn-based combat. Battles can be frenetic at times, with impact sounds and cries of pain. Blood-splatter effects are frequently depicted as characters are injured during combat; red blood stains can sometimes be seen on the ground.",

Players assume the role of a Star Wars character (e.g., droid, villain, starfighter) and battle various soldiers, robots, and creatures across several worlds. Players use blasters, grenades, pulse cannons, and sniper rifles to defeat enemy soldiers, armored vehicles/spaceships, and iconic characters. Combat is frenetic with laser gunfire, explosions, and cries of pain. Some characters can use light sabers and Force powers to engage in close-up combat; a Force Choke move allows players to pick characters up off the ground by their throat, holding them in the air for a time.",

From a side-scrolling perspective, the player's character runs, climbs, and solves puzzles in order to escape danger or proceed through the game's environments. Fail scenarios usually result in the character's injury or death: dogs can maul the boy; fan blades can slice the boy in half; shockwaves can blow the boy apart into chunks of flesh. One cutscene depicts a man being crushed in a fall; a large splatter of blood can be seen on the ground.",

          "synopsis": "This is a strategy game in which players rule the nation of Tropico by tending to citizens' needs (e.g., food, shelter, entertainment, security) while also navigating politics among foreign powers. As dictator (“El Presidente”), players can order their officers to assassinate rebellious citizens. Players can also command soldiers and tanks to quash rebel uprisings or protests; these conflicts are accompanied by realistic gunfire and small explosions. Events occasionally reference suggestive material: “Your family's rather rollicking love life has lead to an unexpected pregnancy”; “…picture me drinking a glass of milk as it runs down my chin from my big soft lips”; “Go, have fun, do the mile high!” The dialogue also contains references to alcohol (e.g., “A preacher I once knew vowed to drink any and all alcoholic beverages he can find…”; “I also wrote their demands on my hand so as not to forget them when I got drunk”). Players can grow tobacco, as well as build cigar factories and rum distilleries in order to create export industries. The word “bastard” appears in dialogue.",

It also replaces the single screens linked together of the original version into a true 2.5D side-scrolling game. While there are various enhancements and details to the character and the scenery, the basic gameplay is still largely similar in a side by side comparison. The GameSpeak system Abe uses to command and talk to other characters start with the same commands, but can later be expanded. This version of the game supports leaderboards for the completion time of each mode and the overall game. There are three difficulty levels and the game. It includes the original cooperative function of the original game when another player can take over when the first player dies, taking turns controlling Abe.",

From a ¾-overhead perspective, players traverse dungeons/crypts, interact with different characters, and engage in various quests. Players use swords, axes, and magic spells to kill human enemies and fantastical creatures (e.g., dragons, trolls, ogres). Battles are accompanied by slashing impact sounds and frequent blood-splatter effects. Some levels depict chamber floors covered in large pools of blood. During the course of the game, players can interact and purchase services from a prostitute—no sexual act is ever depicted. The dialogue can also reference sexual material (e.g., “The prostitute holds her hips, thrusting her chest forward as you come near her” and “But if he spreads a rumor that her lover has just visited a brothel and acquired a pox on his loins, she'll end it on her own.'). The word “f**k” appears in dialogue.",

Travel to the New Lands and welcome the deluge of new mounts, merchants, and vagrants that call these isles home, but be wary of the new obstacles that threaten your arrival -- for not just the greedy creatures block your way but even the environment itself can defeat you.\n\nBe brave, ruler, and fight to the bitter end, lest these New Lands conquer you instead.\"",

As players explore the open-world environment, they can complete mission-based objectives, interact with characters, and engage in combat with criminals and rival gangs. Players use machine guns, shotguns, assault rifles, and explosives to kill enemy thugs and/or civilians; killing civilians, however, may negatively affect their progress. Fire fights are often accompanied by realistic gunfire, large explosions, and blood-splatter effects. Some sequences contain additional acts of violence: a man bleeding out and dying from a stab wound; a man shot and killed by an officer. The game contains some sexual material: a man selling child pornography over the phone (no sexual acts or nudity depicted); a strip club depicting pole dancers and topless women; brief instances of male and female full-frontal nudity (e.g., a woman in body paint; a man standing with a woman outdoors). During the course of the game, characters are depicted smoking marijuana and using needles to inject themselves with drugs; in one sequence, the player's screen warps and blurs after consuming mushrooms laced with acid. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” are heard in the dialogue.",

Elves, trolls, orks and dwarves walk among us, while ruthless corporations bleed the world dry. You are a shadowrunner – a mercenary living on the fringes of society, in the shadows of massive corporate arcologies, surviving day-by-day on skill and instinct alone. When the powerful or the desperate need a job done, you get it done… by any means necessary.\n\nThe unique cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world of Shadowrun has gained a huge cult following since its creation nearly 25 years ago. Now, creator Jordan Weisman returns to the world of Shadowrun, modernizing this classic game setting as a single player, turn-based tactical RPG.\n\nWith the Shadowrun Returns Editor, everyone is empowered to create and share their own stories and campaigns with the Steam Workshop community. You can even explore the entire Shadowrun Returns Seattle campaign in the Editor directly – see how it was built and borrow as much as you need to jump-start your own creations! No advanced coding or art skills are required to create content using the SRR Editor.",

      "summary": "Become the Master Assassin in an intense spy-thriller story. As Agent 47, you perform contract hits on powerful, high-profile targets in exotic locations around the world. Gameplay focuses on taking out targets in huge and intricate sandbox levels with complete freedom of approach. Where to go, when to strike and who to kill – it is all up to you.\n\nHitman is an expanding and evolving world of assassination. The experience began with a Prologue and Paris location in March, continued with Episode 2: Sapienza in April, Episode 3: Marrakesh in May, the Summer Bonus Episode in July, Episode 4: Bangkok in August and Episode 5: Colorado in September. The season finale in Hokkaido, Japan arrived on October 31st.\n\nHITMAN also features a major live component, which is made up of Elusive Targets, Escalation Contracts, Community-inspired Challenge Packs and Contracts Mode.\n\nAn Elusive Target is the closest thing to the Hitman fantasy that we’ve ever created. These targets will be custom-created characters that are added to existing locations and are only there for a limited time in real-time. You’ll only have one chance to take them down. If they escape, they are gone for good. If you kill them, that’s the way that you killed them. There are no do-overs and no second chances. When an Elusive Target leaves the game world (one way or another) they never return.\n\nEscalation Mode is something else completely new for HITMAN and was created as a way to regularly provide a fresh challenge to players. You’ll need to master the location as well as the gameplay mechanics to complete a hit that will escalate in difficulty by adding new elements. This mode has a strong focus on having fun with the game mechanics and mixing them up. It’s more about being playful than realistic.\n\nContracts Mode returns from Hitman Absolution; Play-to-create, mark your own targets, choose how to kill them and compete against your friends. We will also pick the best of the bunch and put them in the Featured Contracts list so you’ve got something fresh to play whenever you load up the game.",

          "synopsis": "This is a stealth action game in which players control Agent 47, an assassin tasked with eliminating targets throughout various missions. From a third-person perspective, players use pistols, machine guns, sniper rifles, and various tools (e.g., poisons, cleavers, explosives) to assassinate human characters. Players can also use stealth attacks (e.g., strangling characters with wires) to eliminate targets and guards at close range. Players have the ability to kill non-adversary characters (e.g., striking them with an ax, shooting them in plain sight), though this may negatively affect players' progress and points. Large blood-splatter effects often occur, and pools of blood appear under victims' bodies. During the course of the game, some female characters are seen unconscious and dragged by players' character; their underwear and portions of their buttocks are sometimes depicted. The dialogue also contains suggestive material (e.g., \"Go get yourself laid or something,\" \"I'm a wh*re,\" and \"...move your pelvis back and forth and in and out.\"). There are also brief references to drugs in dialogue (e.g., “He's probably coked out of his mind” and “You don't have any coke, do you?”). The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “c*ck” are heard in dialogue.",

      "summary": "\"God’s Trigger is a fast paced, top-down, 3D action slasher where you, as a former army veteran and now a priest, begin your crusade against the evil of our times - gangs, drugs, human trafficking. You’re filled with God’s will to purify the world from its depravity. You are the hand of God and there will be no mercy for sinners!\n\nThe main and most unique gameplay mechanics in God’s Trigger is called Divine Focus and gives the player the ability to avoid bullets and tactically plan his attacks. The time is running normally for as long as the player keeps moving. As soon as Zoran stops though, the time slows down too. This allows the player to actually see bullets coming his way and in result avoid them. Even though the player can activate and deactivate Divine Focus whenever he wants, the ability has its limits. To refill its resource, the player needs to kill at least one enemy, without Divine Focus being activated.\n\nAnother feature important for how the gameplay evolves is a One Mistake rule which is really simple in its assumptions. Each hit is fatal for the main protagonist and means the game is over for the player.\n\nThe main reason behind introducing those two mechanics to the game, was to give players the opportunity to experience the joy of a pure, hardcore gameplay, with no place for mistakes. But in the same time, to give them a lot of freedom in clearing up the level and deciding how their play through will look like.\"",

Enemies emit large spurts of blood when shot and killed; a handful of sequences depict bodies lying in pools of blood. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” are heard in the game.",

Damage to a character is shown via a health bar, when this has expired it will fall to the ground and disappear. All of the antagonists in the game carry a weapon, bladed or projectile firing, that can be used against the player’s character and team members, when hit the character will grunt and recoil from the effects but will continue to fight, the violence is realistic-looking. There are no blood effects and when the player’s character dies the game will restart from the last checkpoint. Game also contains the word \"fuck\".",

At some point, a flaming blue fireball, mech mortar rocket, or giant spike of doom is going to hit you in the face, and you’re going to die. That’s when the fun begins.\n\nWhen you die, you’ll leave behind an Echo of your hero on the battlefield. The next hero in line will be able to resurrect your Echo as an AI battle companion. Take turns continuing each other’s games, fighting and dying with friends until you have an entire army of Echoes by your side. Everyone dies. Heroes continue.\n\nNext Up Hero is a 2D action adventure driven by Community Continue. Next Up Hero is inspired by friends taking turns at the arcade to beat unfairly difficult games, and designed so beating a session is a shared victory and more fun than playing on your own.\n\nChoose from nine heroes with an assortment of weapons and abilities to suit your playstyle, from swords and rocket launchers to laser turrets, bongo drums, and boomerangs. Coming this fall, Heroes who complete feats of greatness will gain entry into the Champions Trials, a monthly contest in which Digital Continue throws the hardest monsters they have at you.\n\nDeveloped with community feedback, beginning with an exclusive closed beta at RTX this summer and moving to Steam Early Access in the fall, Digital Continue will incorporate community ideas to improve characters, gameplay, weapons, attacks, and enemy types for the final game.\n\nNext Up Hero is the first game from Digital Continue, founded by Joe Tringali, the co-founder of 5TH Cell, creators of Scribblenauts, Lock’s Quest and Drawn to Life.\n\nFeatures\n\nChampions Trial (Early Access only) - Collect and spend Grand Tokens to gain access to the Champions Trial. These connected adventures will be unique each month. Each Grand Token earns you a single play, so choose your character wisely, and work together with the community to solve puzzles, defeat challenging enemies, and unlock new rewards!\n\nJournal System - Customize and track your own accomplishments stylized like Mad Libs to earn Grand Tokens!\n\nSpotlight Sessions and Leaderboards - Compete with the Community via Daily, Weekly and Monthly Leaderboards! Participate in a Session with your favorite Streamer or Celebrity in VIP Sessions!\n\nAsynchronous Co-Op - Engage in a cutting edge style of cooperative play, Community Continue, where beating community sessions is a shared achievement, and more fun than playing on your own.\n\nCharacter Customization - Defeat enemies to acquire their abilities to combine with your character of choice for thousands of potential deadly loadouts!\n\nAbility-based Progression - Hunt and defeat dozens of monsters to master their abilities on your way to eternal glory!",

Large blood-splatter effects occur frequently as zombies are decapitated and/or dismembered; several environments depict large blood stains amid mutilated bodies. Some zombie creatures are depicted partially nude with exposed buttocks (no genitalia is shown). The word “sh*t” is heard in the dialogue.",

Players can craft weapons from items (e.g., shivs, stun guns, whips) and are able to use tools (e.g., crowbars, brooms, pickaxes) to engage in melee combat with other characters. Prisoners can pummel each other to gain standing, resulting in dizzy-star effects above fallen opponents. Characters sometimes make suggestive comments while inmates are showering (e.g., “That guard's perving on you”; “We're no strangers to love”; “Caught you looking…”; “Not now, got a headache.”).",

Players can shift between first- and third-person perspectives as they explore the open-world environment. Players search for resources, craft tools, build shelters, and create weapons (e.g., spears, bows, machine guns) to hunt and tame dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures. Blood-splatter effects occur as players attack creatures and other human characters; blood can also stain the bodies of defeated enemies. During the course of the game, animals and human characters can be seen defecating, leaving balls of feces on the ground; flatulence sounds can be heard throughout the game. Players' character can craft and consume beer, which results in a screen-blurring effect.",

Players can develop their nation's culture and technology, manage its economic and social infrastructure (e.g., diplomacy, trade) and expand territory through military conquests. Combat with rival nations is presented from a pulled-back, overhead perspective, and military units are represented by small armies of soldiers on a grid map. Battles include animations of swords clashing, gun fights, and vehicular combat that results in icons collapsing, exploding (in the case of vehicles), or disappearing. Historically based text from Civilopedia entries (i.e., reference text) occasionally includes suggestive material (e.g., “From prostitute to pirate lord. . . not the usual career path for a great admiral,” “John didn't think much of Herod's marriage to his half-brother Philip's wife, the adulterous and incestuous Herodias,” and “When Queen Bodica objected, she was flogged and her daughters raped.”). The game also includes historical references to the opium trade (e.g., \"[T]he Qing rulers objected, and attempted to seize incoming opium shipments, inciting the First Opium War in 1839.\"). The words “bastard,” “damn,” and “hell” appear in text.",

          "synopsis": "In this open-world action game, players assume the role of three criminals whose storylines intersect within the fictional city of Los Santos. Players can switch between each character to follow his storyline, completing missions which often include criminal activities (e.g., stealing cars, executing heists, assassinating targets). Players use pistols, machine guns, sniper rifles, and explosives to kill various enemies (e.g., rival gang members); players also have the ability to shoot non-adversary civilians, though this may negatively affect players' progress as a penalty system triggers a broad police search. Blood-splatter effects occur frequently, and the game contains rare depictions of dismemberment. In one sequence, players are directed to use various instruments and means (e.g., pipe wrench, tooth removal, electrocution) to extract information from a character; the sequence is intense and prolonged, and it involves some player interaction (i.e., responding to on-screen prompts). The game includes depictions of sexual material/activity: implied fellatio and masturbation; various sex acts that the player's character procures from a prostitute—while no nudity is depicted in these sequences, various sexual moaning sounds can be heard. Nudity is present, however, primarily in two settings: a topless lap dance in a strip club and a location that includes male cult members with exposed genitalia in a non-sexual context. Within the game, TV programs and radio ads contain instances of mature humor: myriad sex jokes; depictions of raw sewage and feces on a worker's body; a brief instance of necrophilia (no nudity is depicted). Some sequences within the larger game allow players to use narcotics (e.g., smoking from a bong, lighting a marijuana joint); cocaine use is also depicted. Players' character can, at various times, consume alcohol and drive while under the influence. The words “f**k,”“c*nt,” and “n**ger” can be heard in the dialogue.",

The player has no way to fight these characters off and must survive by outrunning them or avoiding them. The player is impaled through the hand, with a large knife complete with blood effects and an open wound once the weapon is removed. There are also scenes of two characters being killed by electrocution while one is physically restraining the other. Moderate swearing to strong language occurs frequently and includes the words ‘bitch’, ‘pissed’, ‘shit’, ‘fuck’ and its derivatives.",

Players follow a storyline, search crime scenes, collect clues, and interview suspects/witnesses in order to solve the cases (e.g., murders, disappearances, thefts). Murder scenes depict beaten or mutilated corpses as well as large amounts of blood. One sequence allows players to perform an autopsy; other scenes involve clinical depictions of bruises, cuts, and evidence of foul play. A handful of scenes contain instances of violence: a character shooting himself in the head with a pistol; a woman drinking poison to commit suicide. One storyline involves an opium den which contains pipes, balls of the drug, and a brief depiction of white powder described as being “like cocaine.”",

Players use pistols, machine guns, assault rifles, and explosives to kill various human enemies (e.g., criminals, police officers). When close to an enemy, players are able to shoot them in the head or knock them out with a black jack. Players have the ability to kill captives after (mostly) off-screen interrogations. Cutscenes depict further instances of violence (e.g., a man stabbed in the neck and shot multiple times). Combat is highlighted by cries of pain, blood-splatter effects, and realistic gunfire. The game includes several depictions of topless female characters. One prolonged scene depicts a topless women standing in a bedroom; another sequence depicts close-ups of topless women sitting down. The game also includes a few instances of sexual activity, including an obscured depiction of masturbation; a woman performing fellatio on a man; and a man thrusting against a woman from behind—camera angles obscure the sex act and no nudity is shown. During the course of the game, the central character sometimes consumes large amounts of alcohol (the screen turns blurry); one sequence depicts characters using needles to inject themselves with drugs. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” can be heard in the dialogue.",

Several different environments, arduous bosses, hidden secrets, multiple endings, and more await Ikk on his journey to make one person happy even if it kills him—which it certainly will.\"",

The game is won when one player ultimately acquires all the shares of their competitors, thereby wresting control of the entire planet’s economy.",

Part of the game's strategy is managing the placement of tiles on the board to create routes for one's creatures to reach the opponent while limiting progress from the opponent.\n\nWinning games earns in-game currency that can be used to purchase new packs of cards, from which the player can then customize their deck. Support for the iOS and Android versions of the game were dropped in 2018 to focus on the PC version. The game also moved out of its free-to-play model and announced plans for card expansion DLCs around the same time.",

      "summary": "London, 1868. The Industrial Revolution unleashes an incredible age of invention, transforming the lives of millions with technologies once thought impossible. Opportunities created during this period have people rushing to London to engage in this new world, a world no longer controlled by kings, emperors, politicians, or religion, but by a new common denominator: money.\n\nNot everyone is able to enjoy the benefits of this boom, however. Despite fueling the engine of the British Empire, workers’ lives are little more than legalized slavery while the top few percent profit from their labor. Living poor and dying young, the lower class unite in protest as a new kind of family, gangs, who turn to a life in the underworld in their struggle to survive. A struggle, until watchful Assassins come to their side and re-ignite an age-old conflict involving London’s leaders that will echo throughout modern history, from the underground up.\n\nIntroducing Jacob Frye, who with the help of his twin sister Evie, will change the fate of millions in Assassin’s Creed Syndicate. Rise to rally and lead the underworld to break the corrupt stranglehold on London in a visceral adventure filled with action, intrigue, and brutal combat.",

As players explore the open-world environment, they interact with characters and engage in missions to kill human targets. Players use an assortment of weapons (e.g., concealed blades, firearms, knives, poison) and employ stealth attacks (e.g., sneaking up and stabbing enemies from behind or above) to eliminate targets. Blood sometimes appears around corpses and/or when characters are injured. Cutscenes depict additional acts of violence: a character stabbed in the head; a man bleeding out after being shot. The game includes reference to drugs in the dialogue (e.g., “A choirmaster and opium addict” and “Does shipping and selling narcotics sound familiar?”) The words “f**k” and “sh*t” are heard in dialogue.

From a first-person perspective, players explore open-world environments, complete objectives, and engage in melee-style combat against bandits and enemy soldiers. Players use swords, knives, and bows to kill enemies; large blood-splatter effects occur during combat, leaving blood stains on bodies and the screen. Players can also injure/kill non-adversary characters, though this may negatively affect players' progress via a penalty system (e.g., fines, jail). A handful of sequences depict additional acts of violence and/or gore: a prisoner executed by decapitation; an eviscerated corpse shown at a crime scene. The game depicts some nude female characters with exposed buttocks and breasts. Brief cutscenes also depict characters engaging in sexual activity: a nude woman climbing atop a man; a man in the background briefly thrusting against a woman—sexual moaning sounds can be heard. During the course of the game, players' character can consume alcohol, resulting in drunkenness (e.g., screen-blurring effects, passing out). The words “f**k,” “c*nt,” and “sh*t” are heard in the dialogue.",

Dishonored and facing his own death, War is given the opportunity to return to Earth to search for the truth and punish those responsible.\n\nHunted by a vengeful group of Angels, War must take on the forces of Hell, forge uneasy alliances with the very demons he hunts, and journey across the ravaged remains of the Earth on his quest for vengeance and vindication.",

      "summary": "A remastered version of the 2012 release, Darksiders II.\n\nAwakened by the End of Days, Death, the most feared of the legendary Four Horsemen, embarks upon a quest to restore mankind, and redeem his brother's name. Along the way, the Horseman discovers that there are far worse things than an earthly Apocalypse, and that an ancient grudge may threaten all of Creation.\n\nDarksiders II follows the exploits of Death, one of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, in an action-packed tale that runs parallel to the events in the original Darksiders game. This epic journey propels Death across an expansive gameworld as he tries to redeem his brother, War, the horseman blamed for prematurely starting the Apocalypse in Darksiders.\n\nLike the original Darksiders game before it, the second iteration of the series is primarily a hack 'n slash adventure. The game takes place across netherworld environments, including 'The White city', an outpost where angels live, and 'The Eternal Throne', a floating fortress where the Lords of the Dead stand guard over souls that need to be cleansed. Although Death is the most feared of the Four Horsemen, his physical abilities are very different than his brother, War. Death is far more nimble, and relies on a combination of melee and ranged attacks. In combat Death's primary weapon is his huge iconic scythe, with a wide range of other weapons and usable items that must be gathered as the game progresses. Weapons can be dual-wielded, upgradable armor can be acquired for protection and Death has access to his terrifying and powerful mount, Despair.",

From a first-person perspective, players must move objects to unlock doors, bypass obstacles, and avoid various hazards (e.g., stationary gun turrets and exploding drones). Robotic drones can be destroyed, resulting in mild explosions; realistic gunfire is heard as turrets fire at players. The text occasionally references suggestive material (e.g., \"you make love like a rocket launcher”; \"'...our porn too I guess\"; “Autoeroticism”; “Prisons are built with stones of law, brothels with bricks of religion.”). The word “a*s” also appears in text.",

Enjoy the mayhem that is unleashed as you put that plan into motion.",

Within a white maze-like environment, players use pistols, machine guns, swords, and special abilities (e.g., manipulating time, taking over enemy bodies) to kill crystalline humanoid figures (i.e., red silhouette-like figures). Realistic gunfire is frequently heard in the game; enemies break apart/disintegrate when killed. Text within the game contains references to drugs (e.g., “I think I shot some dealers...\" and “I just wrecked a dope lab of some sorts”).",

          "synopsis": "This is an adventure game, based on the Fables comic-book franchise, in which players assume the role a sheriff (Bigby Wolf) investigating a mysterious murder. As players progress through the branching storyline, they are presented with dialogue and action choices. Some choices can result in depictions of intense violence: a character tearing a creature's arm off; a character ripping a man's throat out; a character repeatedly shot. Large blood-splatter effects frequently occur during battle; some sequences depict decapitated characters and corpses on the ground. The game contains some sexual material: players can visit a strip club depicting a topless pole dancer; players can visit a hotel where sexual moaning is heard—though no sex acts are depicted. The central character is persistently depicted smoking cigarettes, and some sequences allow players to control whether to share these cigarettes with others. Drugs are occasionally referenced in the dialogue (e.g., “She used mundy drugs” and “I hear they only go for the legs if they've used up the veins in their arms . . . or if they're trying to hide the marks.”); a corpse is depicted with needle track marks on its legs. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “c*nt” are heard in dialogue.",

Defend your idyllic island kingdom against a horde of Viking invaders, as you lead the desperate exodus of your people. Command your loyal subjects to take full tactical advantage of the unique shape of each island. Everything is at stake: fail, and watch the blood of your subjects stain the ground red.\n\nIt’s charmingly brutal, with beautiful procedurally-generated islands and adorable soldiers juxtaposed against the blood-stained realities of war. You control the broad strokes of the battle, giving high level commands to your soldiers who try their best to carry them out in the heat of the moment. It’s accessibly deep, with simple player inputs masking a dynamic combat simulation that make it inviting to new players while challenging veterans.\n\nKeep fighting, warriors. Not for power or riches or glory, but for hope of peace to come once again in the harsh lands of the Bad North.",

Players go door-to-door collecting candy, points, cards, battle stamps and quest assignments as they prepare themselves for Combat Mode-where they transform into larger-than-life versions of their costumes. Each costume that comes-to-life provides its own unique set of superpowers that players will need to battle Halloweens worst monsters.",

Players mine resources (e.g., fuel, rare metals, water), build dome structures, and manage inhabitants' needs along the way. Characters may die of malnutrition or commit suicide if their “sanity” levels fall too low; this is conveyed mostly through text, as inhabitants are simply depicted collapsing and lying on the ground after death. Players can also construct turrets to defend their bases from rival corporations' attacks; missiles and explosions accompany these brief attack sequences. Colonists have a variety of character traits that affect their productivity, including alcoholism; text briefly references alcohol addiction (e.g., “We all find our own ways to cope with this pressure. Tsvetan Hasanov finds it in the bottle.”). The word \"hell\" appears in text.",

Players traverse a variety of locations around Gotham while battling thugs, examining crime scenes, and occasionally rescuing hostages. Players engage in melee-style combat using punches, kicks, and gadgets (e.g., batarangs, explosives). Enemies cry out in pain when struck, and some takedowns are highlighted by brief slow-motion effects and loud impact sounds. Some sequences allow players to use tank-like vehicles with machine gun turrets and rockets to shoot enemies; a vehicle's wheels are also used to torture an enemy in one sequence. Cutscenes depict characters getting shot (on and off camera) while restrained or unarmed. Large bloodstains/pools of blood appear in crime scenes and in the aftermath of violent acts; one room depicts a person torturing a character on a bloody operating table. During the course of the game, players can shoot unarmed characters and a hostage. Neon signs in a red-light district read “live nude girls” and “XXX.” The words “b*tch,” “gobsh*te,” and “a*s” appear in the dialogue.",

Inspired by H.P. Lovecraft’s novella \"At the Mountains of Madness\", but largely set after the original story.\n\nYou, as Frank Gilman, open your eyes inside a room filled with strange, pulsating noises. Patterns of lights executing a Danse Macabre on the walls is presented by a queer device on the table. Having recalled nothing other than that you’re in Upuaut, an Antarctic base located near south pole, you find the place deserted and have a distinct feeling of something being terribly wrong. Somehow knowing that your memories cannot guide you enforces a strange feeling of vulnerability, a familiar yet alien sensation of being a part of a peculiar whole... Soon you will discover that having used the device during the expedition, you have died but then returned subtly changed, speaking of strange memories and of strange places. You have lost something important or gained something sinister...\n\nExplore the antarctic base, as well as dreams and visions. Study clues, unlock secrets but avoid macabre beings at all cost.",

As players complete mission objectives, they use swords, axes, and spears to kill enemy warriors in melee-style combat. Blood-splatter effects occur frequently as enemies are killed; some areas depict large bloodstains and impaled heads on spikes. Players can also perform finishing attacks (e.g., decapitation, impalements) that are sometimes highlighted by close-up camera angles. Cutscenes depict additional acts of violence: bound warriors decapitated by swords; characters executed with weapon strikes to the head.",

Players explore the town and surrounding woods, interact with characters, solve puzzles, and gather clues along the way. Players must battle humanoid enemies known as the \"Taken\" by using various light sources (flashlights, floodlights, \"flahsbang\" grenades); they can also use pistols and shotguns to kill the enemies. The Taken react to damage by disappearing in a flash of embers and shadows. Cutscenes also depict the Taken wielding axes and killing characters off-screen. In one sequence, a long blood trail can be seen leading up to a wounded character in a cabin. Some characters smoke cigarettes or reference alcohol and hangovers; one cutscene depicts two drunken characters slurring their speech while conversing (e.g., \"I feel like my brain is coming out of my nose. I'm gonna get the recipe off those kooks and be a, a, a booze millionaire!.\"). Language such as \"sh*t,\"\"a*shole,\" and \"b*tch\" can be heard in the dialogue.",

      "summary": "In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle.\n\nThe pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive.\n\nMake life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.",

Players encounter fantastical creatures (giant spiders, lizard miners, mutant creatures, etc.) that must be killed to proceed. Players use hatchets, sabers, maces, spears, or magic to strike at the creatures. Bright red blood particles emit from injured creatures, stick to the floor, then disappear within a few seconds; the particles are somewhat \"splotchy\" and unrealistic-looking, though they appear with some frequency.",

Rites of passage and Senior year traditions set the stage for a group of friends sneaking off to Edwards Island, an old military outpost with no phone service. Players will take on the role of Alex as she brings her new stepbrother Jonas to an overnight party gone horribly wrong. Inspired by classic cult films like Stand by Me and Poltergeist, Oxenfree is an adventure that pulls from the past but looks to the present. “It’s a coming of age story where players control how their hero comes of age,” says Sean Krankel, co-founder of Night School. “We’re drawing on the fond and mortifying aspects of being in your late teens, and setting it against a dangerous and ghostly backdrop.”",

From a side-scrolling perspective, players traverse platforms while using a blaster-like gun to shoot fantastical creatures (e.g., giant squids, insects, worms) and bosses. One level contains human-like ghouls that shriek as they run towards the player. Enemies explode into particles and pixels when defeated. The words “damned” and “hell” appear in the dialogue.",

Players run, leap, and cling to walls throughout each maze-like level to avoid a variety of hazards (e.g., meat grinders, spinning buzz saws, propellers). Meat Boy leaves behind gooey red liquid when he lands on these hazards, causing him to disappear in a red spray of blood. Some cutscenes also depict instances of violence: Meat Boy is blown up by a rocket, resulting in cartoonlike blood; a girl stomps and dances on a character named Dr. Fetus, causing puffs of blood to appear. The game also contains an instance of bathroom humor: after a toilet gets flushed, a brown character, Brownie, emerges and emits flatulence. One cutscene also depicts a character who sticks out his middle finger.",

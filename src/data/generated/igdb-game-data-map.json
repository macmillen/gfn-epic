Every minute is a fight for survival as you encounter Super Mutants, Ghouls, Raiders and other dangers of the Wasteland. Prepare for the future.\n\nThe third game in the Fallout series, Fallout 3 is a singleplayer action role-playing game (RPG) set in a post-apocalyptic Washington DC. Combining the horrific insanity of the Cold War era theory of mutually assured destruction gone terribly wrong, with the kitschy naivety of American 1950s nuclear propaganda, Fallout 3 will satisfy both players familiar with the popular first two games in its series as well as those coming to the franchise for the first time.",

You will use your skills to inspire the lowly and protect the weak... whether they like it or not. Your squadmates will be more dear to you than your kin and for those that survive there will be honor, respect and the spoils of war.",

The controller triggers also cause the respective brother to interact with the game world, such as talking to a non-player character or grabbing onto a ledge or object.\n\nThe older brother is the stronger of the two and can pull levers or boost his younger brother to higher spaces, while the younger one can pass between narrow bars. The player progresses by manipulating the two brothers at the same time to complete various puzzles, often requiring the player to manipulate both brothers to perform differing functions (such as one distracting a hostile non-player character while the other makes their way around).\n\nShould either brother fall from a great height or get injured, the game restarts at a recent checkpoint. All of the in-game dialogue is spoken in a fictional language, thus the story is conveyed through actions, gestures and expressions.",

It is the semi-sequel to 2009's Wolfenstein, however utilizes very little from the game and drops any direct references to veil or supernatural.\n\nTo progress through the story, the player battle enemies throughout levels. The game utilizes a health system in which players' health is divided into separate sections that regenerate; if an entire section is lost, the player must use a health pack to replenish the missing health. In combat, a cover system can be used as assistance against enemies. The player have the ability to lean around, over, and under cover, which can be used as a tactical advantage during shootouts and stealth levels. The game gives the player a wide variety of weapon options—they can be found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or removed from their stationary position and carried around.",

The story shifts to an alternate reality where Alan Wake finds himself in a small Arizona town. Here, he faces off against his evil doppelgänger, Mr. Scratch, a murderous entity intent on destroying everything Alan holds dear.\n\nThe gameplay involves exploring the town, battling new and familiar supernatural enemies, and uncovering pieces of the narrative through manuscripts and other clues. The expansion introduces new weapons and combat mechanics while maintaining the series' focus on the use of light to combat darkness. The narrative explores themes of duality and reality, offering a more action-oriented experience compared to the original game.",

When the powerful or the desperate need a job done, you get it done… by any means necessary.\n\nThe unique cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world of Shadowrun has gained a huge cult following since its creation nearly 25 years ago. Now, creator Jordan Weisman returns to the world of Shadowrun, modernizing this classic game setting as a single player, turn-based tactical RPG.\n\nWith the Shadowrun Returns Editor, everyone is empowered to create and share their own stories and campaigns with the Steam Workshop community. You can even explore the entire Shadowrun Returns Seattle campaign in the Editor directly – see how it was built and borrow as much as you need to jump-start your own creations!

During the day, players traverse an expansive urban environment overrun by a vicious outbreak, scavenging the world for supplies and crafting weapons to defend against the growing infected population.

It also replaces the single screens linked together of the original version into a true 2.5D side-scrolling game. While there are various enhancements and details to the character and the scenery, the basic gameplay is still largely similar in a side by side comparison. The GameSpeak system Abe uses to command and talk to other characters start with the same commands, but can later be expanded. This version of the game supports leaderboards for the completion time of each mode and the overall game. There are three difficulty levels and the game. It includes the original cooperative function of the original game when another player can take over when the first player dies, taking turns controlling Abe.",

Created by Double Fine's lead animator, Tasha Harris, the game follows the adventure of a group of young friends who must rid their neighborhood of monsters using only their wits, their bravery, and their home-made costumes. Players go door-to-door collecting candy, points, cards, battle stamps and quest assignments as they prepare themselves for Combat Mode — where they transform into larger-than-life versions of their costumes. Each costume that comes to life provides its own unique set of superpowers that players will need to battle Halloween's worst monsters.",

These enemies can be stabbed, stamped upon, and attacked with weapons that produce corrosion and burning. There is frequent dismemberment and decapitation, as well as sight of bones being broken, with accompanying blood, wound and gore effects. The game also contains use of strong language ('fuck'). Dead bodies are frequently seen on the ground. Some have been cut in half or are missing limbs and there is often sight of internal organs. One scene shows a character removing a metal shard from their stomach, causing profuse bleeding. There are references to marijuana use and sight of marijuana use, although the player's character is not able to use the drug.",

Nearly 40 Alaska Native elders, storytellers and community members contributed to the development of the game.\n\nIt features two characters, and it can be played in single-player mode or play cooperatively with a friend as you trek through frozen tundra, leap across treacherous ice floes, swim through underwater caverns and face enemies both strange and familiar.\n\nYou'll explore awe-inspiring environments, perform heroic deeds and meet legendary characters from Iñupiaq stories — all narrated by a master storyteller in the spoken Iñupiaq language.",

The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle.\n\nThe pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive.\n\nMake life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.",

Despite fueling the engine of the British Empire, workers’ lives are little more than legalized slavery while the top few percent profit from their labor. Living poor and dying young, the lower class unite in protest as a new kind of family, gangs, who turn to a life in the underworld in their struggle to survive. A struggle, until watchful Assassins come to their side and re-ignite an age-old conflict involving London’s leaders that will echo throughout modern history, from the underground up.\n\nIntroducing Jacob Frye, who with the help of his twin sister Evie, will change the fate of millions in Assassin’s Creed Syndicate. Rise to rally and lead the underworld to break the corrupt stranglehold on London in a visceral adventure filled with action, intrigue, and brutal combat.",

The game is presented in isometric view, and the player interacts with the environment to find hidden passages as Ida progresses to the map's exit. Each of the ten levels has a different central mechanic. Interactions include moving platforms and pillar animals, and creating bridges. The player is indirectly cued through the game by design elements like color, and directly cued by crow people, who block Ida's path. Critics compared the game's visual style to a vibrant M. C. Escher drawing and Echochrome. The game includes a camera mode where the player can roam the level to compose screenshots. It includes filters à la Instagram.",

    "summary": "Become the Master Assassin in an intense spy-thriller story. As Agent 47, you perform contract hits on powerful, high-profile targets in exotic locations around the world. Gameplay focuses on taking out targets in huge and intricate sandbox levels with complete freedom of approach. Where to go, when to strike and who to kill – it is all up to you.\n\nHitman is an expanding and evolving world of assassination. The experience began with a Prologue and Paris location in March, continued with Episode 2: Sapienza in April, Episode 3: Marrakesh in May, the Summer Bonus Episode in July, Episode 4: Bangkok in August and Episode 5: Colorado in September. The season finale in Hokkaido, Japan arrived on October 31st.\n\nHITMAN also features a major live component, which is made up of Elusive Targets, Escalation Contracts, Community-inspired Challenge Packs and Contracts Mode.\n\nAn Elusive Target is the closest thing to the Hitman fantasy that we’ve ever created. These targets will be custom-created characters that are added to existing locations and are only there for a limited time in real-time. You’ll only have one chance to take them down. If they escape, they are gone for good. If you kill them, that’s the way that you killed them. There are no do-overs and no second chances. When an Elusive Target leaves the game world (one way or another) they never return.\n\nEscalation Mode is something else completely new for HITMAN and was created as a way to regularly provide a fresh challenge to players. You’ll need to master the location as well as the gameplay mechanics to complete a hit that will escalate in difficulty by adding new elements. This mode has a strong focus on having fun with the game mechanics and mixing them up. It’s more about being playful than realistic.\n\nContracts Mode returns from Hitman Absolution; Play-to-create, mark your own targets, choose how to kill them and compete against your friends. We will also pick the best of the bunch and put them in the Featured Contracts list so you’ve got something fresh to play whenever you load up the game.",

Use the Wii U GamePad to become the malevolent ColourMaster controlling the colours and the obstacles in the level, or tackle our toughest game mode, The Bowhemoth, a 30+ minute platforming challenge that will put the patience and skill of even the toughest players to the test.\n\nIf dozens of game modes, hundreds of unlockable costumes, and a crazy, colourful gaming challenge sounds like fun, then you better get ready to Runbow!",

    "summary": "Faeria is a digital collectible card and turn-based strategy game that takes place on a dynamic playing board set in a fantasy universe. Players in Faeria battle one-on-one against other players or computer-controlled opponents. Battles take place on a empty hex board and the goal for each player is to reduce the opponent's avatar health to zero before their own is exhausted. Part of the game's strategy is managing the placement of tiles on the board to create routes for one's creatures to reach the opponent while limiting progress from the opponent.\n\nWinning games earns in-game currency that can be used to purchase new packs of cards, from which the player can then customize their deck. Support for the iOS and Android versions of the game were dropped in 2018 to focus on the PC version. The game also moved out of its free-to-play model and announced plans for card expansion DLCs around the same time.",

    "summary": "Oxenfree is a supernatural adventure game. Rites of passage and Senior year traditions set the stage for a group of friends sneaking off to Edwards Island, an old military outpost with no phone service. Players will take on the role of Alex as she brings her new stepbrother Jonas to an overnight party gone horribly wrong. Inspired by classic cult films like Stand by Me and Poltergeist, Oxenfree is an adventure that pulls from the past but looks to the present. “It’s a coming of age story where players control how their hero comes of age,” says Sean Krankel, co-founder of Night School. “We’re drawing on the fond and mortifying aspects of being in your late teens, and setting it against a dangerous and ghostly backdrop.”",

It has an custom respawn system, 16 levels, 12 track soundtrack, competitive scoring, and a simple-to-use level creation feature.\n\nThe challenging levels are balanced with the inclusion of a simple yet unique respawn system wherein the player can leave a checkpoint at any location at any point, as long as they are on solid ground. Players have a number of gameplay modes to choose from, whether they want it easy, normal, or they want to try their hand at a mode designed specifically for Speed Running.\n\nBeyond the visual aesthetic, the challenging level design, and the abundance of features, there is the fantastic soundtrack composed by James Bennett, which brings the simple 3-color atmospheres to life.",

    "summary": "England, 12th century: Philip the monk becomes Prior of the small abbey of Kingsbridge. At the same time, a boy called Jack is raised by his outlawed mother in the woods. His apprenticeship as a stonemason paves his way to become a great architect. Soon, his steps lead him to Kingsbridge where he will build one of the greatest cathedrals England has ever seen. Aliena and Richard have to survive on their own, after the sibling's father, the Earl of Shiring, has been incarcerated and murdered. Aliena vows to make her brother the rightful heir and Earl of Shiring. Like Jack, their way leads them to Kingsbridge. Aliena puts her expertise as a tradeswoman to good use, supporting the cathedral's construction and falls in love with Jack. But Kingsbridge and its people are in grave danger. Philip's rivals, Bishop Waleran and Wiliam, a vengeful noble rejected by Aliena, see the town and its rise to importance as a thorn in their flesh. They want to see Kingsbridge burn.\n\nThe game-adaption of the world-bestseller \"The Pillars of the Earth\" is the first co-operative project of Daedalic Entertainment and Bastei Lübbe. This game will be more than just complementary media to the book and will instead retell the story in a new, interactive way. A team of about 20 people works to create a multi-platform adaption of this bestseller. The writers are also in contact and co-operation with the Follett Office and Ken Follett himself. Daedalic is the only studio at the time adapting such an epic reading-experience into an interactive format.\n\nThe game itself will be released in 2017, at the same time the third novel of the Kingsbridge-Series will be published. The game will be internationally available for PC, Mac, Linux, PS4, Xbox One and mobile devices.",

    "summary": "A remastered version of the 2012 release, Darksiders II.\n\nAwakened by the End of Days, Death, the most feared of the legendary Four Horsemen, embarks upon a quest to restore mankind, and redeem his brother's name. Along the way, the Horseman discovers that there are far worse things than an earthly Apocalypse, and that an ancient grudge may threaten all of Creation.\n\nDarksiders II follows the exploits of Death, one of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, in an action-packed tale that runs parallel to the events in the original Darksiders game. This epic journey propels Death across an expansive gameworld as he tries to redeem his brother, War, the horseman blamed for prematurely starting the Apocalypse in Darksiders.\n\nLike the original Darksiders game before it, the second iteration of the series is primarily a hack 'n slash adventure. The game takes place across netherworld environments, including 'The White city', an outpost where angels live, and 'The Eternal Throne', a floating fortress where the Lords of the Dead stand guard over souls that need to be cleansed. Although Death is the most feared of the Four Horsemen, his physical abilities are very different than his brother, War. Death is far more nimble, and relies on a combination of melee and ranged attacks. In combat Death's primary weapon is his huge iconic scythe, with a wide range of other weapons and usable items that must be gathered as the game progresses. Weapons can be dual-wielded, upgradable armor can be acquired for protection and Death has access to his terrifying and powerful mount, Despair.",

    "summary": "While seeking life on a distant planet, an astronaut discovers an abandoned Russian town. He suspects his mission is a hoax until a mysterious young woman saves him from a strange and deadly phenomenon... Lifeless Planet is a third-person action-adventure that features an old-school sci-fi story and spectacular environments in the spirit of classic action-adventures.\n\nAfter a hard landing on the planet, the astronaut discovers the planet that was reported to be rich with life is instead a barren wasteland. When he goes searching for his crew, he makes a more startling discovery: evidence that humans have already been to this planet years ago! When he comes upon a deserted Soviet-era Russian town, he struggles to make sense of his mission. Did his light-speed travel to the planet send him back in time? Or is this all some strange Cold War hoax?\n\nAlong the way, the astronaut meets a Russian woman, Aelita, who is somehow able to survive the hostile atmosphere of the planet. Through an unusual natural phenomenon, her skin causes the soil to glow green under her feet. The player must use these glowing tracks as a guide across the planet past treacherous and deadly threats. Is she leading him to safety... or an untimely death?\n\nLifeless Planet was inspired by Cold War era science fiction stories, posing questions about humankind's desire for space travel. What if you journeyed across the galaxy to another planet, only to find humans had already been there? What kind of person would sign up for a one-way mission, leaving behind planet Earth and everyone they've ever known and love... to go in search of an Earth-like planet?\n\nEquipped with a limited-use jet-pack and a mobile robotic arm, the player must use wits and skill to solve puzzles, unravel the mystery, and survive the Lifeless Planet!\n\nKey Features:\n\n-Explore 20 unique and atmospheric environments on a vast and treacherous planet.\n-Follow a mysterious young woman as she guides you past dangerous terrain and deadly life-forms.\n-Investigate the startling discovery of an abandoned Russian town.\n-Experience an exciting and intriguing story through rich graphics and cinematic cut-scenes.",

Inspired by H.P. Lovecraft’s novella \"At the Mountains of Madness\", but largely set after the original story.\n\nYou, as Frank Gilman, open your eyes inside a room filled with strange, pulsating noises. Patterns of lights executing a Danse Macabre on the walls is presented by a queer device on the table. Having recalled nothing other than that you’re in Upuaut, an Antarctic base located near south pole, you find the place deserted and have a distinct feeling of something being terribly wrong. Somehow knowing that your memories cannot guide you enforces a strange feeling of vulnerability, a familiar yet alien sensation of being a part of a peculiar whole... Soon you will discover that having used the device during the expedition, you have died but then returned subtly changed, speaking of strange memories and of strange places. You have lost something important or gained something sinister...\n\nExplore the antarctic base, as well as dreams and visions. Study clues, unlock secrets but avoid macabre beings at all cost.",

Travel to the New Lands and welcome the deluge of new mounts, merchants, and vagrants that call these isles home, but be wary of the new obstacles that threaten your arrival -- for not just the greedy creatures block your way but even the environment itself can defeat you.\n\nBe brave, ruler, and fight to the bitter end, lest these New Lands conquer you instead.\"",

    "summary": "Meat Boy and Bandage Girl have grown as a couple since 2010. It seems like only yesterday the two love birds were escaping from an exploding laboratory in the sky. Now it’s the current year, and they’ve welcomed their daughter Nugget into the world. Their peaceful days enjoying life as a family came to an abrupt end when Dr. Fetus beat the snot out of them with a rusty shovel, and kidnapped Nugget! Now it’s up to Meat Boy and Bandage Girl to rescue their daughter from a lunatic fetus in a jar that can only be described as an incel version of Tony Stark.\n\n- Super Meat Boy Forever is the sequel to Super Meat Boy! This is a new experience that eclipses the original. Don’t stare directly at it unless you still have your eclipse glasses.\n- 7200 individually handcrafted levels combine dynamically to give you a new challenge every single time you play. Seven thousand two hundred levels. They said we couldn’t do it, but we did. Who’s they? Don’t ask. They don’t like it when you ask.\n- It’s hard, but fair. Nothing in life worth having comes easy. Just ask Dark Soulman.\n- Meat Boy and Bandage Girl can fight back. It’s time to unleash the raw fury of parenthood on their foes just like Liam Neeson in that documentary about his family vacation in Paris.\n- Bigger boss battles than before. Your mind will be blown. Your socks will be blown off. Team Meat is not liable for any of this.\n- Brand new art with stunning detail and resolution. There are a lot of pixels in here. Grab the biggest display you have and watch those dots change color rapidly with gumption. Don’t sit too close though. (If your parents aren’t home you can sit as close as you want we won’t tell, but Team Meat is still not liable for any of this.)\n- A soundtrack composed by Ridiculon so intense that the state of Wyoming has issued a ban on all audio devices capable of playing it out of fear that just a single note will cause the dormant super volcano beneath Yellowstone to erupt ushering in a new age of darkness.\n- Frame by frame artisan crafted in game animations, and animated cutscenes that will make you experience procedurally generated emotions.\n- A story so rich and moving that it makes Citizen Kane look like an unboxing video for a dehumidifier.",

At some point, a flaming blue fireball, mech mortar rocket, or giant spike of doom is going to hit you in the face, and you’re going to die. That’s when the fun begins.\n\nWhen you die, you’ll leave behind an Echo of your hero on the battlefield. The next hero in line will be able to resurrect your Echo as an AI battle companion. Take turns continuing each other’s games, fighting and dying with friends until you have an entire army of Echoes by your side. Everyone dies. Heroes continue.\n\nNext Up Hero is a 2D action adventure driven by Community Continue. Next Up Hero is inspired by friends taking turns at the arcade to beat unfairly difficult games, and designed so beating a session is a shared victory and more fun than playing on your own.\n\nChoose from nine heroes with an assortment of weapons and abilities to suit your playstyle, from swords and rocket launchers to laser turrets, bongo drums, and boomerangs. Coming this fall, Heroes who complete feats of greatness will gain entry into the Champions Trials, a monthly contest in which Digital Continue throws the hardest monsters they have at you.\n\nDeveloped with community feedback, beginning with an exclusive closed beta at RTX this summer and moving to Steam Early Access in the fall, Digital Continue will incorporate community ideas to improve characters, gameplay, weapons, attacks, and enemy types for the final game.\n\nNext Up Hero is the first game from Digital Continue, founded by Joe Tringali, the co-founder of 5TH Cell, creators of Scribblenauts, Lock’s Quest and Drawn to Life.\n\nFeatures\n\nChampions Trial (Early Access only) - Collect and spend Grand Tokens to gain access to the Champions Trial. These connected adventures will be unique each month. Each Grand Token earns you a single play, so choose your character wisely, and work together with the community to solve puzzles, defeat challenging enemies, and unlock new rewards!\n\nJournal System - Customize and track your own accomplishments stylized like Mad Libs to earn Grand Tokens!\n\nSpotlight Sessions and Leaderboards - Compete with the Community via Daily, Weekly and Monthly Leaderboards! Participate in a Session with your favorite Streamer or Celebrity in VIP Sessions!\n\nAsynchronous Co-Op - Engage in a cutting edge style of cooperative play, Community Continue, where beating community sessions is a shared achievement, and more fun than playing on your own.\n\nCharacter Customization - Defeat enemies to acquire their abilities to combine with your character of choice for thousands of potential deadly loadouts!\n\nAbility-based Progression - Hunt and defeat dozens of monsters to master their abilities on your way to eternal glory!",

Newcomers will get the chance to experience one of the finest story-driven shooters of all time; an epic adventure combining gripping survival horror, exploration and tactical combat and stealth.\n\nThis definitive version also includes all previously released DLC, adding 10 hours of bonus single-player content to the huge solo campaign. Fans of the original game will notice new features and gameplay improvements, including new melee animations, the ability to check your watch and ammo supplies on the fly, and new full-body player animations.\n\nAnd those who favoured the more survival-horror oriented gameplay of the cult prequel ‘Metro 2033’ will find a new way to experience the campaign thanks to the introduction of two unique Play Styles – Survival and Spartan. The former transforms Last light from a more action-oriented stealth combat experience to a fraught, slow burn fight for survival. With the legendary Ranger Mode included to offer an extra layer of challenge and immersion, Metro: Last Light Redux offers hours of AAA gameplay for an incredible price.",

The player is impaled through the hand, with a large knife complete with blood effects and an open wound once the weapon is removed. There are also scenes of two characters being killed by electrocution while one is physically restraining the other.

You’re filled with God’s will to purify the world from its depravity. You are the hand of God and there will be no mercy for sinners!\n\nThe main and most unique gameplay mechanics in God’s Trigger is called Divine Focus and gives the player the ability to avoid bullets and tactically plan his attacks. The time is running normally for as long as the player keeps moving. As soon as Zoran stops though, the time slows down too. This allows the player to actually see bullets coming his way and in result avoid them. Even though the player can activate and deactivate Divine Focus whenever he wants, the ability has its limits. To refill its resource, the player needs to kill at least one enemy, without Divine Focus being activated.\n\nAnother feature important for how the gameplay evolves is a One Mistake rule which is really simple in its assumptions. Each hit is fatal for the main protagonist and means the game is over for the player.\n\nThe main reason behind introducing those two mechanics to the game, was to give players the opportunity to experience the joy of a pure, hardcore gameplay, with no place for mistakes. But in the same time, to give them a lot of freedom in clearing up the level and deciding how their play through will look like.\"",

Dependant on its size, when a character is hit it will either be killed in a relatively short time or if a ‘Boss’ it will take considerably more hits to achieve its death. Damage to a character is shown via a health bar, when this has expired it will fall to the ground and disappear. All of the antagonists in the game carry a weapon, bladed or projectile firing, that can be used against the player’s character and team members, when hit the character will grunt and recoil from the effects but will continue to fight, the violence is realistic-looking. There are no blood effects and when the player’s character dies the game will restart from the last checkpoint. Game also contains the word \"fuck\".",

The story takes root from various pieces of Nordic folklore. The game is unique in that it purposefully has no dialog or narrative. Players must breathe in their surroundings to solve various puzzles and speculate the meaning of a lost ancient civilization. Play as an ordinary red fox who’s story becomes entwined with the guardian of the Northern Lights, a female spirit fox. As you journey over the mountains and under red stained skies you’ll discover more about your companion and a land left in ruin.\"",

Brief outline of the game Among Us is a strategy game in which the crewmates of a spaceship, or an airship, must find out which of their teammates are imposters, while they prepare their ship for launch. Content specific issues There are scenes of mild violence involving cartoon-like characters inside space suits. The violence is non-realistic, as are the reactions to the violence. Other issues This game offers players the opportunity to purchase additional content, such as new maps, outfits and pets. Some parents or carers may want to be aware of this. Parents, carers or other responsible adults should check to see what is being offered before making any purchase on behalf of a child.

    "summary": "Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is a third-person action-adventure with an open world hub. Unlike previous Lego games in which players had to advance through the story in a linear order, players can now choose to start the game from any of the main Skywalker Saga episodes and complete them in any order they wish. Each episode has their own hub filled with planets featured prominently in each respective film that can be visited and explored. Each episode will have five story missions each, a total of 45 levels.\n\nCombat has also been revamped, such as lightsaber fights now involving a variety of combos with light attacks, heavy attacks, and Force moves, and blaster characters having an over-the-shoulder camera angle featured in many third-person shooter games.\n\nRandom encounters will also happen in the game's hub. For example, an Imperial Star Destroyer will suddenly jump out of hyperspace and send a fleet of TIE Fighters after the player. Players can choose to engage in dogfights with them or continue onward to progress the story. The game will have more than 200 playable characters, though TT Games has said that number will change.",

    "summary": "Shop Titans is a simulation RPG game that consists of building your own shop within a fantasy kingdom. In it, you can craft and sell armor, swords, potions and all kinds of gear and equipment to heroes to help them in their adventures. With the money from the sales you can expand and customize your shop to become a business mogul in the village. Heroes of all kinds can enter your store: warriors, wizards, dwarves... even ninjas! Help your heroes and champions in legendary battles against the most powerful bosses!\n\nThe quest mode of Shop Titans is similar to other famous RPG and simulation style games. You will recruit a team of heroes who will battle against ogres, orcs and other creatures in epic combat. Use sword or magic to defeat them and receive gold coins to spend in your store. In addition, these quest rewards will give you materials to help create new weapons and gear, enabling you to access increasingly difficult duels.\n\nBuild up your store as fast as possible to support the heroes who will protect and defend your village. Get rich by selling items you craft in your store, building a crafting empire! For each epic war a hero fights successfully, you will receive rewards for equipping them with weapons and armor. Open a chest to discover what new items you have available to build new swords, shields, armor and more!",

You control the broad strokes of the battle, giving high level commands to your soldiers who try their best to carry them out in the heat of the moment. It’s accessibly deep, with simple player inputs masking a dynamic combat simulation that make it inviting to new players while challenging veterans.\n\nKeep fighting, warriors. Not for power or riches or glory, but for hope of peace to come once again in the harsh lands of the Bad North.",

Another notable scene shows a man's head being repeatedly slammed into steps as he pleads for the attacker to stop. Blood pools on the steps with every hit until his body falls limp and he dies.

These are your rules.\nRemastered with enhanced graphics, Steelport the original city of sin, has never looked so good as it drowns in sex, drugs and guns.\nYears after taking Stilwater for their own, the Third Street Saints have evolved from street gang to household brand name, with Saints sneakers, Saints energy drinks and Johnny Gat bobblehead dolls all available at a store near you. The Saints are kings of Stilwater, but their celebrity status has not gone unnoticed. The Syndicate, a legendary criminal fraternity with pawns in play all over the globe, has turned its eye on the Saints and demands tribute.\nRefusing to kneel to the Syndicate, you take the fight to Steelport, a once-proud metropolis reduced to a struggling city of sin under Syndicate control. Take a tank skydiving, call in a satellite-targeted airstrike on a Mexican wrestling gang, and fight against a highly-trained military force by your lonesome in the most outlandish gameplay scenarios ever seen.\nWeapons of Crass Destruction – It’s one thing to defeat your enemies. It’s another to humiliate them. Hover jets, human cannonball cars and outrageous melee weapons are all part of the fun.\nCrazy Character Customisation – Create the most outlandish characters ever seen, from washed-up celebrities to maskless ninja pirates. Inside every sinner, there is a Saint. Who will you become?\nOver The Top Co-op – Fly solo or play online with a homie. Give freefall skydiving a try, landing in your partner’s flaming pickup as you make a desperate run toward a heavily armed Syndicate base. Steelport is always more fun with a friend.\nAll DLC included – All three expansion mission packs and 30 pieces of DLC from the original version.",

Confront the differing terrains as a lonely mountaineer and make your way through Ice, Snow and Stone. Use items to keep up your steadily sinking stats, while making your way up and down the insurmountable heights. The dynamic and ever-changing weather system, the day-night cycles, and numerous other events will make sure that you meet tough challenges on your journey to the top.\n\nTo live up to these challenges, you are able to improve your character. By earning experience points through events, you can choose skills to help you with certain playstyles. One of the serveral roguelike elements is permadeath, which forces you to try various strategies in your pursuit to summit the mountain.\n\nThe game focuses, on the one hand, on the decisions you make in a risky environment full of uncertainties, on the other hand, on evoking intense emotions people experience in such a harsh and savage environment.",

There are no graphic images of injury but text descriptions do refer to climbers being in pain, bleeding or being fearful. Such events may also be accompanied by a suspenseful soundtrack. Some of the routes feature eerie surroundings, in which the player is told they are being followed by sounds and noises, although nothing is visually depicted. If players run out of health, oxygen or body temperature, they may collapse, although this is not shown visually. Instead, the game will show a figure lying in the snow and explain what happened, after which the player can set out on a new journey.",

During the game, players spread their influence across Westeros through a combination of strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and military might. As one of the Great Houses, will you conquer with force, forge alliances, rally your townsfolk, or cunningly coerce your way to the Iron Throne?\n\nBased on the best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones: The Board Game – Digital Edition allows up to six players to play online, or a single player with up to five AI opponents to play locally. The game is set after the death of King Robert Baratheon and allows each player to assume the role of one of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms in an attempt to assault King’s Landing and claim the Iron Throne.\n\nTo be declared ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, you have 10 rounds to use diplomacy and warfare to your advantage to control as many strategic areas of the map.\nConquer with care as your resources are scarce and your troops are not expendable. Muster your army, plan your orders wisely and seize strategical lands with your Footmen, Knights, Siege Engine and ships.\nDuring the turmoil of a battle, use well-known characters from your house to take the upper hand and vanquish your enemies.",

    "summary": "Saturnalia is a survival-horror adventure inspired and heavily influenced by the folklore of Sardinia, Italy, a region rich with unique traditions and culture. You play as four characters, experiencing a deeply connected storyline that ties back to the haunting traditions of this ancient village. The village itself is an elaborate maze with no two iterations being precisely the same - you will have to explore and solve the mysteries of the game largely unguided. Die, and watch the village reconfigure itself into a new form. Solve puzzles and open shortcuts to new areas with tools and items you find along the way, unlocking every piece of the story with different characters, each suited for another aspect of exploration and investigation. With a limited supply of matches to light your way and darkness encroaching, can you find your way through the fog to reveal the truth? Or will you be engulfed by the secrets this town doesn’t want you to know?",

Although the animation is minimal, the sequence is protracted and disturbing, with the character continuing to speak while covered in their own blood. Suicide and self-harm are key themes in the game. In one sequence, a character is found hanging by the neck from a noose, although the moment of death is not shown. There are multiple verbal references to suicide, including a disturbed character encouraging other characters within the game to take their own lives. This is shown in the context of the character's obsessive and aberrant behaviour and suicide is not glamorised or normalised. There are references to self-harming behaviour, including cutting. The game also features use of strong language ('fuck'), as well as milder terms.",

Violence towards fantasy characters, such as orcs, is similar in nature, although the use of grenades can cause explosions of blood and chunks of matter. The game also contains use of sexual expletives in Spanish and Italian.",

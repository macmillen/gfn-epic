This is a personal project which came to life after I coundn't find information online about all epic games which are available for GeforceNow. Since the GeforeNow doesn't have an automatic sync feature it's hard to find out which free games you can actually play on that platform.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`          | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `npm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
